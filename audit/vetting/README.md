# pphi2 — per-axiom vetting records

One file per architectural axiom, format per
[`templates/vetting-entry.md`](https://github.com/math-commons/formalization-assurance/blob/main/templates/vetting-entry.md)
in the assurance hub.

## Status (2026-06-23)

| Rung | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Vetting record landed (with detailed evidence) | **5 / 26** | items 1, 2, active Layer-B2 lattice item 3, 17 plus B5b `groundVariance_le_freeCovariance` |
| Vetting record landed (citation-form) | **19 / 26** | items 4–16, 18–23 — point at existing evidence in `docs/`, `AXIOM_AUDIT.md`, `planning/INDEX.md`, and Route-A Layer-B2 plans |
| Private scaffolding | **2 / 26** | `asymTorusInteracting_exponentialMomentBound`, `gaussian_rp_cov_perfect_square` |
| **Total covered** | **26 / 26** | all real axioms have a record |
| Statement hashes populated | 0 / 26 | required for L3 strictness |

All 26 active real axioms now have a record. The directory also retains the
discharged torus-level record
`asymInteractingVariance_le_freeVariance_Lt_uniform.md` for provenance.
Most are citation-form — they point at the existing vetting evidence in
[`../../docs/gemini_review.md`](../../docs/gemini_review.md) (Feb 2026 group
review), [`../../AXIOM_AUDIT.md`](../../AXIOM_AUDIT.md) (rolling log),
per-axiom discharge plans in [`../../docs/`](../../docs/), and the live status
machine [`../../planning/INDEX.md`](../../planning/INDEX.md).

The detailed records (items 1, 2, 3, 17) capture verbatim verdict summaries
where the vetting was rich enough to quote. The citation-form records assert
the vetting happened, name the source doc, and carry forward the verdict; they
do not reproduce the full verbatim transcript (which lives in the cited doc).

**Strictness ladder.** [`policy.yml`](policy.yml) is at **L1** (warn). Now
that coverage is at 26/26, the project is ready to raise to **L2**
(coverage-enforce) once a CI gate reads this directory. Raising to **L3**
additionally requires populating `statement_hash` in each record.

## Where the vetting evidence lives today

Vetting evidence for pphi2's axioms is currently scattered across:

- [`../../AXIOM_AUDIT.md`](../../AXIOM_AUDIT.md) — dated-entries narrative log
  (newest first); records gemini deep-think verdicts, codex cross-checks,
  literature citations, and discharge-plan revisions.
- [`../../planning/INDEX.md`](../../planning/INDEX.md) — per-axiom status,
  difficulty, dependencies, and link to the live discharge plan.
- [`../../docs/`](../../docs/) — per-axiom discharge plans (many gemini-vetted),
  e.g. `B4B5-design.md` for Layer B2, `asym-expmoment-discharge-via-lee-yang-vet-request.md`
  for Layer A, `cyl-1a-bridge-plan.md` for the Layer C assembly, etc.

The vetting records under this directory are intended to **consolidate**
that evidence into one record per axiom (with verbatim model prompts and
replies), in the hub's reproducible format.

## How to add a record

```bash
cp ~/Documents/GitHub/formalization-assurance/templates/vetting-entry.md \
   audit/vetting/<AxiomName>.md
$EDITOR audit/vetting/<AxiomName>.md
# Then add a `vetting:` row to AXIOM_AUDIT.md → Sources column.
```

A vetting record can cite a verbatim model prompt + reply (the strongest
form, used for new or strengthened axioms) **or** point to an existing
literature proof (LP code) **or** a previous deep-think vetting captured
in `AXIOM_AUDIT.md` (DT code with a date pointer). See `VETTING.md` in
the hub for the convention.

## Axiom inventory

The 26 active real axioms (24 architectural + 2 private scaffolding) are the
target population. For the canonical list with file:line locations see
[`../../formalization.yaml`](../../formalization.yaml) and
[`../../planning/INDEX.md`](../../planning/INDEX.md).
