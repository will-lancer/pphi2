**Current axiom statement (the earlier all-`P` map is historical):**

The live declaration is quartic-only. `Ls` is the section parameter, with
`[Fact (0 < Ls)]`.

```lean
/-- Volume-uniform interacting exponential-moment bound on the cylinder.

There exist constants `K > 0` and `C > 0` such that, for every cylinder geometry
`(Nt, Ns, a)` with fixed `Ls = Ns · a` and for every test function `f`,

  ∫ exp |⟨ω, f⟩| dμ_int(ω) ≤ K · exp(C · σ²(f))

where `μ_int` is the interacting asymmetric-torus measure and `σ²(f)` is the
free covariance.

The quartic hypothesis is consumed by `cylinderIso_OS_of_RP_OS2`; the current
theorem proves cylinder OS2 from the heterogeneous lattice construction and
carries reflection positivity through the no-wrap limit. -/

The earlier all-`P` statement and its `AsymTestFunction` / lattice-measure
notation are retained in repository history. They do not describe the live
axiom. The restriction `hP : P.n = 4` is part of the current contract.

**Reasoning digest:** *Likely correct.* The quartic `∃ K, C > 0` form with
the `C · σ²` exponent is the current volume-uniform interacting-moment
contract for P(φ)₂. The earlier `C = 1` and all-`P` forms are historical
records. The current declaration remains an axiom; its consumers prove OS2
from the heterogeneous lattice symmetries and carry reflection positivity
through the no-wrap limit.

**Conditions / follow-ups:**

- *Discharge architecture* (3 layers, per
  [`../../docs/asym-interacting-expmoment-volume-uniform-discharge-plan.md`](../../docs/asym-interacting-expmoment-volume-uniform-discharge-plan.md)):
  - **Layer A** = Newman MGF Gaussian-domination
    (`asymInteracting_mgf_gaussianDominated`, item 2 in `planning/INDEX.md`)
    — depends on the new
    [`lee-yang`](https://github.com/mrdouglasny/lee-yang) repo (Phase 1
    polynomial side done, measure side still to go).
  - **Layer B2** = interacting variance dominated by free variance. The
    torus statement `asymInteractingVariance_le_freeVariance_Lt_uniform`
    is now a theorem; active item 3 is the lattice Route-A input
    `asymInteractingVariance_le_freeVariance_lattice_Lt_uniform`. The
    remaining gap is the lattice Route-A finite-K/B5b/free-assembly closure.
  - **Layer C** = the ~50-line assembly here (this axiom).
- *Re-vet if strengthened*: any tightening of `C` to a specific functional
  form (e.g. `C = 1/(2m²)`) requires a fresh deep-think + literature pass;
  the current sound form is the qualified existential.
- *Statement-hash*: not yet populated; required to raise this record to L3
  (statement-hash freshness gate). Compute the hash once the statement
  stabilizes after the Layer-C assembly lands.
