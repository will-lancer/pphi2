# Vetting — `spectral_gap_uniform`

> **⚠ AXIOM REMOVED (2026-07-12).** This vetting record is retained for provenance only.
> The axiom was **removed as FALSE as stated**: at fixed `Ns` with `a → 0` the physical
> volume shrinks and the hard-coded 2D Wick counterterm over-subtracts (zero-mode `~ a⁻²`),
> giving the spatial zero mode a double well whose tunneling splitting closes the gap at
> every coupling (hand computation + Gemini 3.1-pro verification; consumer trace confirmed
> the axiom was a dead branch). Final rating: **FALSE / removed**. Replacement design:
> `planning/cyl-2a-volume-scaling-addendum.md` (17a/17b). See `AXIOM_AUDIT.md` (2026-07-12).

**Statement form** (informal): `∃ m₀ > 0, ∃ a₀ > 0, ∀ a ≤ a₀, massGap ≥ m₀` —
the uniform mass gap of the lattice transfer matrix survives the
continuum limit `a → 0`.

**Vetting source.** [`docs/gemini_review.md`](../../docs/gemini_review.md) §"Group 3:
Transfer Matrix and Spectral Gap" / `spectral_gap_uniform` entry.

**Verdict (verbatim):**

> CORRECT — this is the central result of Glimm-Jaffe. Statement form:
> `∃ m₀ > 0, ∃ a₀ > 0, ∀ a ≤ a₀, massGap ≥ m₀`. This correctly captures
> the uniform mass gap bound needed for the continuum limit.
>
> Proof difficulty: VERY HARD — requires Glimm-Jaffe-Spencer cluster
> expansion techniques.

**Conditions / follow-ups:**

- **Regime-restriction caveat** (from [`planning/INDEX.md`](../../planning/INDEX.md) item 17 +
  [`planning/cyl-2a-spectral-gap.md`](../../planning/cyl-2a-spectral-gap.md)): the axiom
  as stated is **too strong** — φ⁴₂ has a phase transition where the gap closes,
  so the axiom needs a weak-coupling / single-phase hypothesis. The "uniform
  in `a`" is correct; the missing scoping is the coupling regime.
- **Re-vet if strengthened**: any change to the quantifier structure (e.g.
  removing the `∃ a₀` cutoff) requires a fresh deep-think + literature pass.
- **Discharge route**: `a → 0` eigenvalue-gap limit / perturbative analysis
  at weak coupling. The finite-`a` gap `asymGappedTransfer'` is PROVED;
  continuum uniformity remains.

- Downstream consumers: items 14 (`two_point_clustering_from_spectral_gap`),
  15 (`general_clustering_from_spectral_gap`) — ride on the proved B2 trace
  bridge once the gap lands.
