## Project Overview

Formal construction of the P(Phi)_2 Euclidean quantum field theory in Lean 4,
following the Glimm-Jaffe/Nelson lattice approach. The main theorem constructs
a probability measure on S'(R^2) satisfying all five Osterwalder-Schrader axioms
(OS0-OS4), which by reconstruction yields a Wightman QFT in 1+1d Minkowski
spacetime with a positive mass gap.

See README.md for the full mathematical description and proof outline.

## Build

```bash
lake build
```

The project depends on [gaussian-field](https://github.com/mrdouglasny/gaussian-field)
(expected at `../gaussian-field`) and Mathlib (fetched automatically by lake).

CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `lake build` on PRs and pushes to `main` via
[leanprover/lean-action](https://github.com/leanprover/lean-action).

## Status Tracking

After finishing a work sequence (proving axioms, eliminating sorries, or any
code changes), always:

1. Run `./scripts/count_axioms.sh` to get current axiom/sorry counts
2. Update the counts in **status.md** (header line and per-file table)
3. Update the counts in **README.md** (the "Current status" section)
4. Commit status/README updates together with the code changes

## Lean 4 Working Methods

### Build-First Workflow

Always build before and after changes. Use `lake build` to check the full
project. For faster iteration on a single file, use:
```bash
lake env lean Pphi2/SomeFile.lean
```

### Axiom vs Sorry vs Theorem Conventions

- **`axiom`**: Unproved mathematical statements with real content — things that
  would require a nontrivial mathematical argument to prove. Each axiom should
  have a detailed docstring explaining the mathematical content, proof strategy,
  and references.
- **`sorry`**: Incomplete proofs or definitions where the Lean formalization
  is not yet done, but the mathematical approach is clear.
- **Placeholder `True` conclusions**: Should be `theorem ... := trivial`,
  NOT axioms. Axioms should only be used for substantive mathematical claims.
- When converting an axiom to a theorem, update the inventory tables in
  status.md.
- When introducing new axioms, use `deep_think_gemini` to verify the
  mathematical correctness of each axiom statement before committing.
  Mark unverified axioms with **(NOT VERIFIED)** in status.md.
  Record verification provenance in top-level `AXIOM_AUDIT.md`.

### Helper Lemma Principle

Only introduce helper lemmas that are **simpler** or **more general** than
the lemma you're using them to prove.

**Good helpers:**
- Atomic mathematical facts (`|e^{it}| = 1`, `cos` bounded by 1)
- Definitional bridges connecting notation to implementation
- Reusable techniques used across multiple proofs
- Standard algebraic identities

**Avoid:**
- Technical infrastructure of similar complexity to the main goal
- Single-use chains that just shuffle hypotheses
- "Setup" lemmas that don't reduce conceptual complexity

### When Stuck on a Proof

Try to **formulate a textbook axiom** — a provable mathematical fact that:
- Uses only Mathlib definitions (no project-specific types)
- Would close the sorry if available
- Is a standard result from Glimm-Jaffe, Simon, Reed-Simon, etc.

This separates the **mathematical content** (the textbook fact) from the
**formalization plumbing** (connecting it to project types). The textbook
fact can often be stated cleanly and its proof attempted independently.

### Common Lean 4 Patterns in This Project

- **Coercion mismatches** between `LinearIsometryEquiv`, `ContinuousLinearEquiv`,
  and plain functions: use `convert` tactic to bridge
- **`ae_of_all μ`** (not `Eventually.of_forall`) for "for all" in ae context
- **`Real.norm_eq_abs`** to bridge `‖x‖` and `|x|` for real numbers
- **`SchwartzMap.compCLMOfAntilipschitz`** for composing Schwartz functions with
  antilipschitz temperate-growth maps
- **`HasTemperateGrowth`** has `.sub`, `.const`, `.comp` combinators

### Before Reverting or Dropping Code

Do not delete significant code without identifying a clear blocker. If blocked:
1. Explain the blocker before deleting
2. Document what was learned (useful Mathlib lemmas, proof strategies, dead ends)
3. Extract value: helper lemmas, mathematical insights, API discoveries

## Skills and Tools

### `/lean-preflight`

Pre-development check: verifies Lean LSP connectivity, git status, toolchain
