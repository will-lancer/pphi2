## What this project proves

**Main theorem** (`Pphi2/Main.lean`): For any even polynomial P of degree ≥ 4
bounded below and any mass m > 0, there exists a probability measure μ on the
space of tempered distributions S'(ℝ²) satisfying all five Osterwalder-Schrader
axioms:

- **OS0 (Analyticity):** The generating functional Z[Σ zᵢJᵢ] is entire analytic
  in z ∈ ℂⁿ.
- **OS1 (Regularity):** ‖Z[f]‖ ≤ exp(c(‖f‖₁ + ‖f‖ₚᵖ)) for some 1 ≤ p ≤ 2.
- **OS2 (Euclidean Invariance):** Z[g·f] = Z[f] for all g ∈ E(2) = ℝ² ⋊ O(2).
- **OS3 (Reflection Positivity):** The RP matrix Σᵢⱼ cᵢcⱼ Re(Z[fᵢ − Θfⱼ]) ≥ 0.
- **OS4 (Clustering):** Z[f + Tₐg] → Z[f]·Z[g] as ‖a‖ → ∞.

By the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction theorem, the corresponding
mathematical theorem in the literature yields a relativistic Wightman QFT in
1+1 Minkowski spacetime with a positive mass gap. This repository currently
formalizes the Euclidean OS side, not the reconstruction step itself.

This is the theorem originally proved by Glimm-Jaffe (1968–1973), Nelson (1973),
and Simon, with contributions from Guerra-Rosen-Simon and others.

**Non-triviality** (that the constructed theory is genuinely interacting, not a disguised free field)
is a separate result: the continuum φ⁴₂ measure on T² is **non-Gaussian** (`u₄ ≠ 0`) at weak coupling,
proved **axiom-free** (`torus_pphi2_isInteractingStrict_weakCoupling`). See "Current status →
Non-triviality" below.

## Scope and foundations direction

This repository currently formalizes one specific Euclidean-QFT formulation:
the Glimm-Jaffe/Nelson construction of a positive probability measure on
`S'(ℝ²)` for bosonic scalar `P(Φ)₂`. It does not yet formalizes gauge fields,
fermions, chemical potential, or topological terms.

A framework for defining QFTs on general spacetimes
(compact manifolds, lattices, manifolds with boundary) with separated spacetime
geometry and field content is a WIP. An exploratory organizational proposal is in
[`docs/foundational-roadmap.md`](docs/foundational-roadmap.md), with a
technical reference for the current formulation-layer code in
[`docs/formulation-layer.md`](docs/formulation-layer.md) and open design
questions (general manifolds, multiple fields, fermions, signed/complex
measures) in
[`docs/formulation-layer-questions.md`](docs/formulation-layer-questions.md).

## Proof approach

The construction proceeds in six phases:

1. **Lattice measure** — Define the Wick-ordered interaction
   V_a(φ) = a² Σ_x :P(φ(x)):_a on the finite lattice (ℤ/Nℤ)² and construct
   the interacting measure μ_a = (1/Z_a) exp(−V_a) dμ_{GFF,a}.

2. **Transfer matrix** — Decompose the lattice action into time slices. The
   transfer matrix T is a positive trace-class operator. This gives reflection
   positivity (OS3).

3. **Spectral gap** — Show T has a spectral gap (λ₀ > λ₁) by Perron-Frobenius.
   This is the lattice mass gap; OS4 on the periodic torus is phrased with **cyclic**
   Euclidean-time separation (`latticeEuclideanTimeSeparation` in `OS4_MassGap.lean`),
   and the textbook continuum clustering picture is recovered after IR/continuum limits.

4. **Continuum limit** — Embed lattice measures into S'(ℝ²), prove tightness
   (Mitoma + Nelson's hypercontractive estimate), extract a convergent
   subsequence by Prokhorov. OS0, OS1, OS3, OS4 transfer to the limit.
   The free (Gaussian) case is handled separately in `GaussianContinuumLimit/`:
   the lattice GFF measures are tight (Mitoma criterion with uniform m⁻²
   second-moment bound from the spectral gap of −Δ_a + m²), their weak
   limits are Gaussian (Bochner-Minlos), and the covariance converges to
   the continuum Green's function G(f,g) = ∫ f̂(k)ĝ(k)/(|k|²+m²) dk/(2π)².

5. **Euclidean invariance** — Restore full E(2) symmetry via a Ward identity
   argument. The rotation-breaking operator has scaling dimension 4 > d = 2,
   so the anomaly is RG-irrelevant and vanishes in the continuum limit; in the
   super-renormalizable `P(Φ)₂` setting one allows at most polynomial
   `|log a|` corrections, still multiplied by the vanishing `a²` factor.

6. **Assembly** — Combine all axioms into the main theorem.

## Four routes (spacetimes)

The construction is carried out on four spacetimes, each targeting different
OS axioms. See [ROUTES.md](ROUTES.md) for the detailed comparison.

### Route A: ℝ² (Euclidean plane) — OS0–OS4
The full construction targets S'(ℝ²) and proves all five OS axioms.
The continuum limit involves both UV (a → 0) and IR (volume → ∞) limits.
**Status (updated 2026-07-13):** the full target (UV **and** IR limits). The headline
`pphi2_existence` was made *honest* in **Phase 4.1** — the δ₀-vacuity loophole in `IsPphi2Limit`
is closed, and existence now rests on the vetted textbook axiom `pphi2_limit_exists`
(**Fröhlich 1976 / Park 1977** tightness route, *not* the earlier Glimm–Jaffe Ch. 8 framing,
which fails for general even deg ≥ 6 `P` — Ellis–Monroe–Newman; see
[`planning/r2-honest-headline-spec.md`](planning/r2-honest-headline-spec.md)). `#print axioms
Pphi2.pphi2_existence` = Mathlib trio + 5 named axioms (4 OS-inheritance + `pphi2_limit_exists`).
The genuinely *interacting* ℝ² headline additionally needs the (now-designed) keystone-18
weak-coupling uniqueness ([`planning/keystone-18-campaign.md`](planning/keystone-18-campaign.md)).
The Phase-B Glimm–Jaffe Fourier estimates are theorems
(`#print axioms Pphi2.rough_error_variance` ⟹ `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`). Current
counts: [`AXIOM_AUDIT.md`](AXIOM_AUDIT.md) (authoritative) / [`docs/AXIOM_STATUS.md`](docs/AXIOM_STATUS.md).
Discharge history: [`docs/STATUS_HISTORY.md`](docs/STATUS_HISTORY.md).

### Route B: T²_L (symmetric torus) — OS0–OS2
Finite-volume warm-up isolating the UV limit. Lattice (ℤ/Nℤ)² with
spacing a = L/N → 0. The interacting continuum limit `torusInteractingLimit_exists`
is proved via Mitoma-Chebyshev tightness + Nelson's exponential estimate
(proved: physical volume a²N²=L² is constant). OS3 dropped (→ Routes B', C).

**`TorusInteractingOS.lean`: 0 local axioms, 0 sorries** — OS0–OS2 complete (OS0 via a fully verified
Osgood lemma + Gaussian integrability; OS2 via gaussian-field's proved time-reflection / translation
identities). See [`docs/torus-interacting-os-proof.md`](docs/torus-interacting-os-proof.md) for the
proof overview and [`docs/STATUS_HISTORY.md`](docs/STATUS_HISTORY.md) for the discharge log.

### Route B': T_{Lt,Ls} → S¹_{Ls} × ℝ (asymmetric torus → cylinder) — OS0–OS3
Extends Route B to the cylinder by taking the time direction to infinity.
The construction proceeds in two limits:

1. **UV limit (DONE):** On the asymmetric torus T_{Lt,Ls} = (ℝ/Lt ℤ) × (ℝ/Ls ℤ)
   with lattice (ℤ/Nℤ)² and geometric-mean spacing √(Lt·Ls)/N, take N → ∞.
   Route B's OS0–OS2 proofs are fully adapted to the asymmetric case.
   `AsymTorusOS.lean`: OS0–OS2 complete; the remaining input is the Cluster-A asym Nelson estimate
   `asymNelson_exponential_estimate` (`AsymTorusInteractingLimit.lean`).

2. **IR limit (in progress):** Take Lt → ∞ with Ls fixed. The torus measures
   μ_{P,Lt,Ls} on T_{Lt,Ls} converge weakly to a measure μ_{P,Ls} on the
   cylinder S¹_{Ls} × ℝ. Tightness follows from uniform-in-Lt moment bounds
   via the **method of images** (gaussian-field `Cylinder/MethodOfImages.lean`).
   The IR limit files are in `IRLimit/` with 0 local axioms and 0 sorries,
   plus explicit nonlocal inputs for eventual Green moments and eventual
   pullback reflection positivity.
   `limit_exponential_moment` (MCT + truncation) is now fully proved.
   OS2 (time reflection) of the limit measure is **proved** via characteristic
   functional convergence.

The cylinder S¹_{Ls} × ℝ has a natural time axis ℝ, enabling:
- **OS3 (Reflection positivity):** Time reflection Θ: t ↦ -t is a clean
  involution on S¹_{Ls} × ℝ. The RP matrix for positive-time test functions
  is positive semidefinite, proved from the lattice RP (transfer matrix
  positivity) + weak limit transfer.
- **Transfer matrix:** The cylinder admits a Hilbert space decomposition
  L²(S¹_{Ls}) via spatial slicing at fixed time. The transfer operator
  T = exp(-H) where H is the P(φ)₂ Hamiltonian. Spectral gap of T
  gives the mass gap and clustering.

**Advantages over Route C:** reuses all Route B infrastructure (0 axioms for OS0–OS2); only OS3 (RP)
and the `Lt → ∞` limit are new. **Status (updated 2026-07-13):** UV limit complete
(`AsymTorusOS.lean`, 0 local axioms); IR limit in progress (`IRLimit/`, 0 local axioms, 0
sorries). **The uniform cylinder exponential moment (CYL-1a) is now a THEOREM** — the Layer-B2
interacting≤free variance bound (`asymInteractingVariance_le_freeVariance_lattice_thresholded`)
and the `|f|`-form exp-moment (`asymInteracting_expMoment_volume_uniform_absForm_thresholded`)
both hold on 5–6 vetted axioms (S1 FSS + S2 fixed-`Ls` gap + the τ-form bridge pair + B5b), and
asym exponential clustering (`asymSliceObsTrunc_exponential_clustering_fixedLs`, the OS4 lattice
input) is proved on 2 axioms. Remaining: the sign-restricted Layer-A Lee–Yang axiom
(producer chain proof-complete in the `lee-yang` repo), OS3's eventual-pullback-RP hypothesis,
and the Layer-C rewiring onto the thresholded forms. Design + kernel footprints:
[`planning/b2-route-a-statements.md`](planning/b2-route-a-statements.md),
[`AXIOM_AUDIT.md`](AXIOM_AUDIT.md). Discharge detail: [`docs/STATUS_HISTORY.md`](docs/STATUS_HISTORY.md).

### Route C: S¹_L × ℝ (cylinder, direct) — OS0–OS3
Direct Nelson/Simon construction with natural time axis ℝ for OS reconstruction.
The field is a distribution (not a function), requiring isonormal Gaussian extension.
OS3 uses Laplace factorization of the cylinder Green's function.
**21 axioms + 0 sorries** (preserved in `future/`, not in active build).

### Which OS axiom comes from which route?
| OS axiom | Best route | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| OS0 (Analyticity) | B, B' | Exponential moment bounds (proved) |
| OS1 (Regularity) | B, B' | Clean moment bounds (proved) |
| OS2 (Symmetry) | B' or A | B' for cylinder symmetries, A for full E(2) |
| OS3 (RP) | B' or C | Natural time half-space on cylinder |
| OS4 (Clustering) | B' or A | Transfer matrix spectral gap |

## Construction parameters and renormalization

The construction takes two inputs:

- **P** (`InteractionPolynomial`) — an even polynomial of degree ≥ 4, bounded below.
  Examples: P(τ) = λτ⁴, P(τ) = λτ⁴ + μτ², P(τ) = (τ²−a²)⁴.
  P may have a nonzero quadratic coefficient; the physical mass receives
  contributions from both the Gaussian mass and the quadratic term in P.

- **mass** (`mass : ℝ`, `0 < mass`) — the mass parameter in the Gaussian
  reference measure, whose covariance is (−Δ_a + mass²)⁻¹. This must be
  strictly positive so the lattice operator is invertible (the zero mode
  has eigenvalue mass²). This is a technical requirement for the Gaussian
  reference measure, not a physical restriction on the theory.

The expansion is always around φ = 0, but this does not force the theory
into the symmetric phase. An even polynomial can have its global minima at
±a ≠ 0 (e.g. P(τ) = (τ²−a²)⁴); the functional integral determines which
phase the theory is in.

**Renormalization:** P(Φ)₂ is super-renormalizable in d = 2. The only UV
counterterm is the Wick ordering constant c_a = G_a(0,0) ~ (1/2π)log(1/a),
which is the lattice propagator at coinciding points. The Wick-ordered
interaction :P(φ(x)):_a subtracts the divergent self-contractions at each
lattice spacing. No mass, coupling constant, or wave function
renormalization is needed beyond Wick ordering.

## Consistency checks

Beyond the OS axioms themselves, the construction should satisfy additional
consistency checks:

- **Mass reparametrization invariance.** The physical measure depends on the
  total action, not on how it is split between the Gaussian reference measure
  and the interaction. Shifting the bare mass m → m' while compensating
  P → P + m²/2 − (m')²/2 leaves the total quadratic term (−Δ + m²) + P
  unchanged, so the resulting continuum measure must be identical.
  (Status 2026-07-13: the previous Lean statements were vacuity artifacts of
  the unstrengthened `IsPphi2Limit` and were removed; the conjecture and its
  proof strategy are recorded in `docs/plan.md` § "Deferred consistency
  checks".)

- **Wick ordering scheme independence.** The Wick ordering constant
  c_a = G_a(0,0) depends on the bare mass m through the propagator. A mass
  shift changes c_a, but the compensating shift in P absorbs this, so the
  Wick-ordered interaction :P(φ):_a is scheme-independent up to the total
  action.

- **Torus–infinite volume consistency.** For test functions supported well
  inside T²_L (away from the boundary identification), the torus and
  infinite-volume Schwinger functions should agree in the L → ∞ limit.

## Current status

All six phases are structurally complete and the full project builds
(`lake build`).

Current counter (`./scripts/count_axioms.sh`, 2026-07-13, post-Phase-4.1): pphi2 **31 raw /
29 real axioms**, 0 sorries; gaussian-field **3 axioms**, 0 sorries. The +1 over the
post-B-I-cleanup base (30 raw / 28 real) is `pphi2_limit_exists`
(`Pphi2/ContinuumLimit/Convergence.lean`), the single clearly-labeled OPEN existence input
of the ℝ² headline: the 2026-07-13 Phase-4.1 strengthening of `IsPphi2Limit` (coupled
lattice conjunct `ν k = continuumMeasure 2 (N k) P (a k) mass`, `N k → ∞`, `N k·a k → ∞`)
closed the δ₀ vacuity, so the former Dirac-measure "proof" was replaced by a Gemini-vetted
textbook axiom (Fröhlich 1976 + Park 1977 tightness route; see `AXIOM_AUDIT.md` 2026-07-13
and `planning/r2-honest-headline-spec.md`). `#print axioms Pphi2.pphi2_existence` = Mathlib
trio + 5 project axioms (the 4 OS-inheritance axioms + `pphi2_limit_exists`) — the honest
count. Earlier deltas: +2 = the K-uniform finite-periodic bridge pair (IUC-vetted); +2 = the
vetted B2 route-(a) axioms `fss_infrared_quadratic` (S1) and `asymTransferGap_uniform_fixedLs`
(S2, γ-form fixed-`Ls` a-uniform transfer gap,
`Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymSliceFamilySusceptibility.lean`). The eight
real Layer-B2 Route-A axioms are the six GNS bridge obligations isolated in
`Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymBridgeInstance.lean`, B5b single-slice stability in
`Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymB5bSingleSlice.lean`, and the final lattice Route-A
assembly input `asymInteractingVariance_le_freeVariance_lattice_Lt_uniform`.
(2026-07-12: `spectral_gap_uniform` and `spectral_gap_lower_bound` were
**removed as false as stated** — fixed-`Ns` shrinking-volume regime; see
`AXIOM_AUDIT.md`. They had no proof-term consumers; the corrected coupled-limit
statement is recorded in `planning/cyl-2a-volume-scaling-addendum.md`.)

**2026-07-13 (B2 Stage C landed):** the thresholded master theorem
`asymInteractingVariance_le_freeVariance_lattice_thresholded`
(`Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymVarianceAssembly.lean`) is proved — at fixed `Ls` there are
`C, L₀, a₀ > 0` with `Var_int(G) ≤ C·Var_free(G)` for all lattices with `Ns·a = Ls`,
`a ≤ a₀`, `Nt·a ≥ L₀`. Kernel footprint: Mathlib trio + exactly
{`fss_infrared_quadratic`, `asymTransferGap_uniform_fixedLs`,
`asymFinitePeriodicBridge_diagonal_bound`, `asymFinitePeriodicBridge_remainder_bound_uniform`,
`groundVariance_le_freeCovariance`}. No new axioms; counts unchanged.

Detailed axiom/sorry inventory lives in the single sources of truth:
[`planning/INDEX.md`](planning/INDEX.md) (per-axiom master status machine for the remaining axioms),
[`docs/AXIOM_STATUS.md`](docs/AXIOM_STATUS.md) (axiom inventory), [`BRANCHES.md`](BRANCHES.md) (which
git branch carries the live code for each axiom), and [`status.md`](status.md) (full inventory).
Dated discharge narrative is archived in [`docs/STATUS_HISTORY.md`](docs/STATUS_HISTORY.md).

### Per-route snapshot (the OS-axiom construction)

| Route (spacetime) | OS axioms | State |
|---|---|---|
| **B — T²_L** symmetric torus | OS0–OS2 | **Complete**, 0 local axioms (`TorusInteractingOS.lean`). The most developed route; UV-only limit (N→∞ at fixed volume `L`). |
| **B′ — cylinder** (asym torus → S¹_{Ls}×ℝ) | OS0–OS3 (+OS4 in progress) | UV limit **done**, 0 local axioms. **Layer B2 discharged (2026-07-13):** interacting≤free variance and the \|f\|-form exp-moment are theorems on 5–6 vetted axioms (FSS S1 + fixed-`Ls` gap S2 + the τ-form bridge pair + B5b), and asym exponential clustering (OS4 input) is a theorem on 2 axioms. Remaining: the Layer-A Lee–Yang axiom + continuum-inheritance bridges + Layer-C rewiring to the thresholded form. |
| **A — ℝ²** Euclidean plane | OS0–OS4 | Full target (UV **and** IR limits). **Headline made honest (Phase 4.1):** δ₀ loophole closed; `pphi2_existence` rests on 5 named axioms with existence via a vetted tightness axiom (Fröhlich 1976 / Park 1977). The conjoined "interacting φ⁴₂ QFT exists" statement additionally needs the (now-designed) keystone-18 weak-coupling uniqueness. |
| **C — cylinder, direct** | OS0–OS3 | Preserved in `future/` (21 axioms), **not** in the active build. |

The torus continuum limit (`TorusContinuumLimit/`) is the cleanest backbone: fixing physical volume
`L` and taking only `N→∞` isolates the UV limit from IR issues. Prokhorov extraction on the
configuration space is **proved** (not axiomatized) via gaussian-field's DM-basis
`prokhorov_configuration`; the same pipeline handles both Gaussian and interacting (P(φ)₂) measures
via Cauchy–Schwarz density transfer. The torus Gaussian limit satisfies OS0–OS3 (`TorusOSAxioms.lean`,
all proved).

### Non-triviality (is the theory genuinely interacting?)

Separate from the OS axioms: is the continuum φ⁴₂ measure **non-Gaussian** (`u₄ ≠ 0`)? Both sub-routes
live on the **T² (Route B) spacetime** — these "weak-coupling / dilation" sub-routes are *not* the
spacetime routes A/B/B′/C above.

- **Weak-coupling sub-route — DONE, axiom-free.** `torus_pphi2_isInteractingStrict_weakCoupling`
  (`TorusContinuumLimit/TorusCouplingResult.lean`): for some small coupling `g₀ ∈ (0,1]`, the
  continuum limit of the coupling-`g₀` interacting torus measures has a *strictly negative* connected
  four-point (`TorusIsInteractingStrict`, hence `TorusIsInteracting`). `#print axioms` ⟹
  `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. Design: [`planning/route-A-weak-coupling-plan.md`].
  (Currently on branch `route-a-weak-coupling`, PR #48.)
- **`λ=1` / large-mass normalization — DEFERRED.** Upgrading to full coupling via the continuum
  dilation is sound but entangled with unbuilt clustering / spectral-gap machinery — see the deferral
  note in [`planning/continuum-rescaling-plan.md`].

A **shared foundations layer** (`Common/QFT/Euclidean/{Formulations,ReconstructionInterfaces}.lean`)
separates concrete measure models, tensor-moment / distributional Schwinger data, explicit
reconstruction hypotheses, and backend-independent reconstruction rules.

## Nontrivial infrastructure notes

- **Configuration-space Prokhorov bridge**:
  [SobolevProkhorovPlan.lean](Pphi2/ContinuumLimit/SobolevProkhorovPlan.lean)
  records the staged theorem API to replace
  `prokhorov_configuration_sequential`.
- **Transfer-matrix spectral infrastructure (Jentzsch)**:
  [Jentzsch.lean](Pphi2/TransferMatrix/Jentzsch.lean) contains the
  positivity-improving/Perron-Frobenius spectral input used for mass-gap-level
  statements.
- **Convolution operator infrastructure**:
  [L2Convolution.lean](Pphi2/TransferMatrix/L2Convolution.lean) centralizes
  Young-type analytic dependencies for `L²` convolution operators.
- **Global inventory and difficulty tracking**:
  [status.md](status.md) and [docs/axiom_proof_plans.md](docs/axiom_proof_plans.md).

## Dependencies

- [gaussian-field](https://github.com/mrdouglasny/gaussian-field) — Gaussian
  free field on nuclear spaces, lattice field theory, FKG inequality
- [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) — Lean 4
  mathematics library

## Building

Requires Lean 4. gaussian-field is a git dependency (fetched automatically).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrdouglasny/pphi2.git
cd pphi2
lake build
```

### Continuous integration

Pull requests and pushes to `main` run [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/ci.yml)
using [leanprover/lean-action](https://github.com/leanprover/lean-action): install
the toolchain from `lean-toolchain`, optionally `lake exe cache get` for Mathlib,
then `lake build`. Workflow YAML is checked with [actionlint](.github/workflows/actionlint.yml).
[Dependabot](.github/dependabot.yml) proposes weekly updates for action versions.

## Imported material

The files under `Pphi2/OSforGFF/` (PositiveDefinite, FrobeniusPositivity, SchurProduct,
HadamardExp) are imported from the
[OSforGFF](https://github.com/mrdouglasny/OSforGFF) project, authored by
Michael R. Douglas, Sarah Hoback, Anna Mei, and
Ron Nissim. These provide the Schur product theorem and entrywise exponential
positivity results used in the OS3 reflection positivity proof.

## Future projects

- **Unified OS axiom framework.** Currently the infinite-volume OS axioms
  (`OSAxioms.lean`) and torus OS axioms (`TorusOSAxioms.lean`) are defined
  separately. These should be unified into a single parametric `SatisfiesOS`
  structure taking a `SpaceTime` parameter that encodes the geometry:
  whether space is compact (torus vs ℝ², controlling ergodicity/clustering),
  whether a distinguished time direction exists (enabling reflection positivity),
  the symmetry group (E(2) vs translations × D4), and so on. The OS axioms
  and other consistency tests (e.g. moment bounds, support properties) would
  then be stated once and instantiated for each spacetime. Both the Gaussian
  and interacting measures would be verified against the same axiom bundle.
