## Group 1: Heat Kernel Axioms (gaussian-field)

**File**: `HeatKernel/PositionKernel.lean`

### mehlerKernel_eq_series
- **Verdict**: CORRECT
- **Convention**: Uses H = -d²/dx² + x² (no factor of 1/2), eigenvalues λ_k = 2k+1. Internally consistent.
- **References**: Mehler (1866), Reed-Simon Vol II §X.12, Folland "Harmonic Analysis in Phase Space"
- **Proof strategy**: Substitute ρ = exp(-2t) into Mehler generating function identity, or show closed-form kernel satisfies same PDE with same initial condition.

### mehlerKernel_pos
- **Verdict**: CORRECT — **should be a theorem, not axiom**
- **Proof**: Direct from closed form: (2πsinh 2t)^{-1/2} > 0 and exp(...) > 0. Straightforward `positivity`-style proof.

### mehlerKernel_reproduces_hermite
- **Verdict**: CORRECT
- **Proof strategy**: Substitute series expansion, exchange sum/integral (absolute convergence), apply orthonormality of Hermite functions.

### mehlerKernel_semigroup
- **Verdict**: CORRECT (Chapman-Kolmogorov equation)
- **Proof strategy**: Series expansion + Fubini + orthonormality → collapse double sum → combine exponentials.

### circleHeatKernel_pos
- **Verdict**: CORRECT but proof is non-trivial
- **Proof strategy**: Must use Poisson summation (periodized Gaussian representation), NOT term-by-term positivity of Fourier series. Each Gaussian summand is positive.

### All other heat kernel axioms (summability, symmetry, periodicity, semigroup, reproducing)
- **Verdict**: All CORRECT, standard heat kernel theory.

### Recommendation
- Promote `mehlerKernel_pos` from axiom to theorem (easy proof from closed form).

## Group 2: FKG Inequality and Lattice Structure

### fkg_from_lattice_condition
- **Verdict**: CORRECT (Fortuin-Kasteleyn-Ginibre 1971, Holley 1974)
- **The FKG lattice condition** (log-supermodularity): ρ(x∨y)·ρ(x∧y) ≥ ρ(x)·ρ(y)
- **Proof strategy**: Holley's coupling proof via monotone Markov chain, or induction on |Λ| integrating out one coordinate at a time.
- **References**: Preston (1974) "A Generalization of the FKG Inequalities", Holley (1974)

### gaussian_fkg_lattice_condition
- **Verdict**: CORRECT
- **Key fact**: Precision matrix Q = -Δ + m² has non-positive off-diagonal entries (Q_{xy} = -1 for neighbors), which implies log-supermodularity of the Gaussian density exp(-½⟨φ,Qφ⟩).
- **References**: Pitt (1982) "Positively correlated normal variables are associated"

### fkg_perturbed — FIXED
- **Verdict**: CORRECT (after fix)
- **Key insight**: Convexity of V is NOT needed. For single-site V(φ) = Σ_x v(φ(x)), the weight exp(-V) = Π_x exp(-v(φ(x))) is a product of single-variable functions, which is automatically log-supermodular. Product of log-supermodular functions is log-supermodular.
- **Fix applied** (2026-02-23): Hypothesis weakened from `hV_convex : ConvexOn ℝ Set.univ V` to `hV_single_site` with single-site decomposition.

### ~~latticeInteraction_convex~~ — FALSE → FIXED
- **Verdict**: **Was FALSE** — now removed and replaced.
- **Why it was false**: For P(τ) = τ⁴/4 - μτ² (φ⁴ with negative mass), P''(τ) = 3τ² - 2μ < 0 near τ=0. So P is NOT globally convex. V = Σ P(φ(x)) is NOT convex.
- **Fix applied** (2026-02-23): Axiom removed entirely. Replaced with proved theorem `latticeInteraction_single_site` (V decomposes as sum of single-site functions). Upstream `fkg_perturbed` updated to take `hV_single_site` instead of `hV_convex`.
- **References**: Ellis-Monroe-Newman (1976), Simon *P(φ)₂ Euclidean QFT*

### latticeEnum_norm_bound
- **Verdict**: CORRECT
- **Key fact**: #{x ∈ ℤ^d : ‖x‖₁ ≤ R} = Θ(R^d), so shell enumeration gives ‖enum⁻¹(m)‖₁ ≤ C·(1+m)^{1/d}.
- **Proof strategy**: Shell enumeration by ℓ¹ norm + volume counting.

---

## Group 3: Transfer Matrix and Spectral Gap

### transferEigenvalue_pos
- **Verdict**: CORRECT
- **Proof**: T has strictly positive kernel → positivity-improving → no zero eigenvalue. Combined with positive-definiteness gives all eigenvalues > 0.
- **References**: Reed-Simon Vol IV §XIII.12

### transferEigenvalue_antitone
- **Verdict**: CORRECT (enumeration convention)
- **Essentially definitional**: eigenvalues listed in decreasing order via min-max principle.

### transferEigenvalue_ground_simple (Perron-Frobenius)
- **Verdict**: CORRECT
- **Perron-Frobenius is applicable**: T = exp(-aH) has strictly positive continuous kernel on L²(ℝ^{N_s}), making it positivity-improving. The infinite-dimensional Perron-Frobenius theorem (Reed-Simon IV, Theorem XIII.44) gives simplicity of the leading eigenvalue.
- **References**: Reed-Simon Vol IV Thm XIII.44, Simon "Functional Integration and Quantum Physics"

### spectral_gap_uniform
- **Verdict**: CORRECT — this is the central result of Glimm-Jaffe
- **Statement form**: ∃ m₀ > 0, ∃ a₀ > 0, ∀ a ≤ a₀, massGap ≥ m₀. This correctly captures the uniform mass gap bound needed for the continuum limit.
- **Proof difficulty**: VERY HARD — requires Glimm-Jaffe-Spencer cluster expansion techniques.
- **References**: Glimm-Jaffe-Spencer (1974), Glimm-Jaffe *Quantum Physics* §19.3

### spectral_gap_lower_bound
- **Verdict**: CORRECT with caveat
- **Caveat**: Linear-in-mass bound (gap ≥ c·mass) is correct for weak coupling and free field. For strong coupling the relationship is more complex, but the existential hides the coupling dependence acceptably.
- **References**: "On the Glimm-Jaffe linear lower bound in P(φ)₂" (1972)

---

## Group 4: OS Axioms and Continuum Limit

### os0_inheritance
- **Verdict**: TRUE but TOO WEAK
- **Issue**: States all moments are finite, but the actual OS0 requires factorial growth bound: |S_n(f₁,...,f_n)| ≤ C^n · n! · Π‖f_i‖_s. Mere integrability is necessary but not sufficient for OS reconstruction.
- **Recommendation**: Strengthen to include the E0' linear growth condition.

### ⚠️ os1_inheritance — VACUOUS
- **Verdict**: **TRIVIALLY TRUE for ALL probability measures** — does not capture OS1
- **Issue**: |∫ cos(ω(f)) dμ| ≤ 1 holds by |cos| ≤ 1 + triangle inequality. The actual OS1 (regularity) requires |Z[f]| ≤ exp(c·‖f‖²_{H⁻¹}).
- **Recommendation**: Replace with actual Sobolev growth bound.

### rp_closed_under_weak_limit (THEOREM, not axiom)
- **Verdict**: CORRECT, genuinely proved
- **The proof is clean**: bounded continuous test function → weak convergence of integrals → limit of nonneg sequence is nonneg.
- **References**: Glimm-Jaffe §19.4, Jaffe "Reflection Positivity Then and Now" (arXiv:1802.07880)

### continuumMeasures_tight
- **Verdict**: CORRECT
- **Proof route**: Mitoma's criterion reduces tightness on S'(ℝ²) to one-dimensional projections → uniform second moment bounds → Chebyshev.
- **References**: Mitoma (1983), Simon *P(φ)₂* §V.1

### second_moment_uniform
- **Verdict**: CORRECT
- **Key bound**: ∫|ω(f)|² dμ_a ≤ e^{C|Λ|} · ⟨f, G_a f⟩ where G_a → G as a→0, giving uniform bound.

### ⚠️ moment_equicontinuity — WRONG AS STATED
- **Verdict**: **MATHEMATICALLY INCORRECT**
- **Issue**: The RHS is a bare constant C, but the bound MUST depend on ‖f-g‖ in a Sobolev/Schwartz norm. Taking f = n·h, g = 0 gives moment ~ n² which defeats any fixed C.
- **Correct formulation**: ∫|ω(f-g)|² dμ_a ≤ C · ‖f-g‖²_s for some Schwartz seminorm of order s.
- **Fix**: Multiply RHS by `schwartz_seminorm_sq s (f - g)`.

---

## Group 5: Wick Ordering, Ward Identity, Reflection Positivity

### wickMonomial_eq_hermite
- **Verdict**: CORRECT
- **Convention**: Uses probabilist's Hermite He_n (Mathlib's `Polynomial.hermite`). Formula :x^n:_c = c^{n/2} · He_n(x/√c) is standard.
- **Verified by checking** n=2,3,4 against proved `wickMonomial_two/three/four`.
- **Proof strategy**: Induction on n using Hermite recursion He_{n+1}(t) = t·He_n(t) - n·He_{n-1}(t) transformed via scaling.
- **References**: Simon *P(φ)₂* §I.3, Glimm-Jaffe §8.6

### wickPolynomial_bounded_below
- **Verdict**: CORRECT
- **Key fact**: Leading term (1/n)x^n dominates lower-order Wick corrections. Even degree + positive leading coefficient → bounded below.
- **Proof strategy**: Split into |x| ≥ R (leading term dominates) and |x| ≤ R (EVT on compact set). Straightforward real analysis.
- **References**: Nelson (1966), Simon §I

### wickConstant_log_divergence
- **Verdict**: CORRECT
- **Convention**: Factor (2π)⁻¹ is correct for d=2 (from ∫d²k/(k²+m²) in momentum space with UV cutoff at π/a).
- **Proof strategy**: HARD — requires Euler-Maclaurin approximation of lattice sum by integral + explicit integral evaluation in polar coordinates.
- **References**: Simon §I.4, Glimm-Jaffe §8.6

### action_decomposition
- **Verdict**: CORRECT in structure
- **Key**: S[φ] = S₊[φ₊,φ₀] + S₊[Θφ₋,φ₀] — nearest-neighbor coupling means action splits at reflection plane.
- **Minor issue**: `sorry` in type signature for NeZero proof (bookkeeping, not mathematical).
- **References**: Osterwalder-Seiler (1978), Fröhlich-Israel-Lieb-Simon (1978)

### ward_identity_lattice + scaling dimension argument
- **Verdict retracted for the current Lean declaration**: its left side
  subtracts an integral from itself. The intended rotated-observable Ward
  identity and its uniform anomaly estimate remain open.
- The dimension-counting discussion is motivation for the missing theorem.
- **References to review for the replacement statement**: Symanzik (1983)
  "Continuum limit and improved action", Huebner et al. (2012) arXiv:1204.4146

## Critical Issues Summary

### Must Fix (mathematical errors)

1. ~~**`latticeInteraction_convex`**~~ — **FIXED** (2026-02-23). Removed and replaced with proved `latticeInteraction_single_site`. Upstream `fkg_perturbed` also updated.

2. **`moment_equicontinuity`** (Tightness.lean:89) — **WRONG as stated**. RHS must depend on ‖f-g‖_s, not be a bare constant.

### Should Fix (too weak to be useful)

3. **`os1_inheritance`** (AxiomInheritance.lean:100) — **VACUOUS**. Replace with actual Sobolev growth bound |Z[f]| ≤ exp(c·‖f‖²).

4. **`os0_inheritance`** (AxiomInheritance.lean:77) — **TOO WEAK**. Strengthen to include factorial growth bound (E0' condition).

### Optimization Opportunities

5. **`mehlerKernel_pos`** — Should be theorem, not axiom (trivial from closed form).

6. ~~**`fkg_perturbed`**~~ — **FIXED** (2026-02-23). Hypothesis weakened from convexity to single-site decomposition.

### Placeholder Axioms (23 with conclusion `True`)

These are structurally harmless but provide no mathematical content. Priority for strengthening:
- Transfer matrix properties (selfAdjoint, positiveDefinite, traceClass, hilbertSchmidt)
- Ward identity + scaling dimension
- Lattice RP
- Schwinger function convergence

## Proof Strategy Recommendations

### Provable now (within Mathlib capabilities)
1. `mehlerKernel_pos` — positivity from closed form
2. `wickPolynomial_bounded_below` — real analysis (EVT + polynomial asymptotics)
3. `transferEigenvalue_antitone` — definitional from enumeration

### Provable with moderate effort
4. `wickMonomial_eq_hermite` — induction + Hermite recursion algebra
5. `mehlerKernel_reproduces_hermite` — series expansion + orthonormality
6. `mehlerKernel_semigroup` — series expansion + Fubini + orthonormality

### Hard (deep analytic content)
7. `mehlerKernel_eq_series` — Mehler's formula (PDE uniqueness or generating function)
8. `circleHeatKernel_pos` — requires Poisson summation
9. `wickConstant_log_divergence` — Euler-Maclaurin + explicit integral
10. `spectral_gap_uniform` — Glimm-Jaffe-Spencer cluster expansion

## Lattice-Action Normalisation Diagnosis Vetting (2026-05-07)

**Topic**: Diagnosis in `docs/lattice-action-normalization-fix.md` —
pphi2's lattice action lacks the `a^d` Riemann-sum prefactor on the
kinetic term, causing the Wick-subtracted interaction `V_a` to scale
as `a^{dk}` and vanish in the continuum limit.

### Verdict per question

- **Q1 (rescaling derivation)** — CORRECT.
  - `α = a^{d/2}` for general `d`.
  - `:φ_x^{2k}:_{wickConstant} = a^{dk} :Φ(x_a)^{2k}:_{c_textbook}`.
  - Conclusion `V_a → 0` for `d ≥ 2, k ≥ 2` confirmed.
- **Q2 (Wick subtraction)** — CORRECT.
  - `c_a := G_a(0,0) = (1/L^d)Σ_k 1/λ_k` is the unique correct
    subtraction for the `a^d`-rescaled action.
- **Q3 (GRS conventions)** — REFINED.
  - GRS-style "absorb `a^d` into Hamiltonian sum" is internally
    consistent only with compensating coefficient rescaling
    `λ_k → a^{-d(k-1)} λ_k`. pphi2 does neither rescaling, so it
    fell into the gap between two equivalent conventions.
- **Q4 (alternative fixes)** — RESOLVED.
  - (a) Polynomial coefficient rescaling: works mathematically but is
    "ugly formalisation".
  - (b) Embedding redefinition: doesn't work — `μ_a^P → μ_a^{GFF}`
    happens at the lattice level, before any embedding.
  - **Rewriting the action is the only robust path.**
- **Q5 (uncertainties §5)** — CONFIRMED.
  - U1 dimensional analysis holds (`α = a^{d/2}`).
  - U3 mixed-degree polynomials all vanish; theory cleanly free
    regardless of `β`.
  - U6 resolved as Q3 above.
- **Q6 (other Lean formalisations)** — UNCHARTED.
  - No mature constructive-QFT or discrete-random-field
    formalisations have pushed far enough into continuum limits to
    hit this trap. Mathlib's probability uses counting measures and
    doesn't attempt Riemann-sum continuum limits.
- **Q7 (cost estimate)** — REVISED.
  - Phase 2 (dynamical-cutoff Nelson) more realistic at **6–8 weeks**
    rather than 2–4. Reason: measure-theoretic friction in
    interactive provers when splitting integration domain into
    small-field / large-field events, bounding Gaussian tails on the
    latter, and recombining.

### Closing question from Gemini

*"Before you commit resources to overhauling
`gaussian-field/Lattice/Covariance.lean`, how cleanly does the
existing Cauchy–Schwarz density-transfer machinery in Route B
separate the functional analytic bounds from the underlying lattice
variance definitions?"*

**Answer** (audit in §3.5 of the diagnosis doc):

The `density_transfer_bound` lemma
(`Pphi2/ContinuumLimit/Hypercontractivity.lean:1072`) consumes
`(K, hK_pos, hK)` (Nelson) and `hZ : 1 ≤ Z` (partition function
lower bound) as opaque numerical hypotheses. It does **not**
reference `wickConstant`, eigenvalues, the action, or `a^d` factors.
Pure Hölder p=q=2 + `MemLp` plumbing — **normalisation-independent**.

Three lattice-touching sites:

1. `partitionFunction_ge_one` — Jensen + GFF-centering. **Stable.**
2. `interactionFunctional_bounded_below` — fixed-`a, N` lemma still
   holds with worse `a`-dependent `B`. None of its ~12 call sites
   use uniformity in `N`, so they survive. **Mechanical.**
3. `nelson_exponential_estimate_lattice` — the actual work of
   Phase 2 (dynamical-cutoff). 4 direct call sites of the easy
   `wickConstant ≤ m^{-2}` bound all reroute through the new proof.

**Net assessment**: ~95% of OS chain (tightness, second-moment,
weak limit, OS0/OS1/OS2 theorems, Asymtorus, IR-limit) inherits
via the abstract `(K, Z ≥ 1)` interface. Surgery contained in 3
files: `gaussian-field/Lattice/Covariance.lean`,
`Pphi2/WickOrdering/Counterterm.lean`,
`Pphi2/NelsonEstimate/NelsonEstimate.lean`.
