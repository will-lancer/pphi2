# Existence of the Continuum Limit

Applies Prokhorov's theorem to extract a weakly convergent subsequence
from the tight family of continuum-embedded measures.

## Main results

- `prokhorov` — tightness implies sequential compactness (axiomatized)
- `continuumLimit` — existence of the P(Φ)₂ continuum measure
- `schwinger_convergence` — Schwinger functions converge

## Mathematical background

### Prokhorov extraction on configuration space

The file contains:
1. A proved generic sequential Prokhorov theorem on Polish spaces.
2. A configuration-specific extraction axiom used for
   `Configuration (ContinuumTestFunction d)`.

### Application

From `continuumMeasures_tight`, the family {ν_a}_{a>0} is tight.
By `prokhorov_configuration_sequential`, any sequence ν_{a_n} with a_n → 0
has a weakly convergent subsequence ν_{a_{n_k}} ⇀ ν.

The limit ν is the P(Φ)₂ Euclidean measure on S'(ℝ²).

### Schwinger functions

The n-point Schwinger functions converge:

  `S_a^{(n)}(f₁,...,fₙ) = ∫ Φ(f₁)···Φ(fₙ) dν_a → S^{(n)}(f₁,...,fₙ)`

This follows from:
1. Weak convergence: ∫ F dν_a → ∫ F dν for bounded continuous F.
2. The function Φ ↦ Φ(f₁)···Φ(fₙ) is not bounded, but uniform
   moment bounds justify the convergence.

/-! ## Prokhorov's theorem

Prokhorov's theorem for Polish spaces: tightness implies sequential
compactness. Derived from Mathlib's `isCompact_closure_of_isTightMeasureSet`
and the Lévy-Prokhorov metrization of `ProbabilityMeasure X`. -/

/-- **Prokhorov's theorem** (sequential version).

On a Polish space X, if a sequence of probability measures {μₙ} is tight,
then it has a weakly convergent subsequence.

Proof strategy:
1. Lift `μ : ℕ → Measure X` to `P : ℕ → ProbabilityMeasure X`
2. Convert the tightness hypothesis to `IsTightMeasureSet`
3. Apply `isCompact_closure_of_isTightMeasureSet` to get compact closure
4. Polish space → ProbabilityMeasure X is metrizable (Lévy-Prokhorov)
   → compact = sequentially compact → extract convergent subsequence
5. Convert back from `ProbabilityMeasure` convergence to integral convergence -/

/-! ## Prokhorov's theorem for configuration space

`Configuration (ContinuumTestFunction d)` is modeled as a weak dual with
cylindrical measurable structure. In this project we use a direct sequential
extraction principle on this space, avoiding any global Polish-space claim for
the full weak-* dual topology.
-/

/-! ### Prokhorov extraction on configuration space

NOTE: The weak-* dual `Configuration(ContinuumTestFunction d)` is NOT Polish
(the weak-* topology is not metrizable for infinite-dimensional spaces).
Previous versions axiomatized `PolishSpace` and `BorelSpace` instances, but
these are **inconsistent**.

Instead, we use `GaussianField.prokhorov_configuration` (proved in gaussian-field)
which embeds `Configuration E` into `ℕ → ℝ` via the DM basis and applies
standard Prokhorov there, avoiding Polish/Borel entirely. -/

/-- **Existence of the P(Φ)₂ continuum limit.**

For any sequence of lattice spacings aₙ → 0, there exists a subsequence
aₙₖ and a probability measure μ on S'(ℝ^d) such that:

  `ν_{aₙₖ} ⇀ μ` weakly

where `ν_a = (ι_a)_* μ_a` is the continuum-embedded interacting measure.

The limit μ is the P(Φ)₂ Euclidean quantum field theory measure. -/

/-! ## Schwinger function convergence -/

-- NOTE: schwinger_n_convergence and continuumLimit_nontrivial were removed
-- as dead axioms. schwinger_n_convergence was only used by schwinger2_convergence
-- (also dead). continuumLimit_nontrivial was never used. The non-Gaussianity
-- result continuumLimit_nonGaussian (below) is the live axiom used in Main.lean.

/-! ### Coupling-regime predicates

These predicates were introduced in `Bridge.lean` and are defined here (upstream
of `Main.lean`) so that the regime-sensitive axioms below can carry them as
hypotheses. See `planning/r2-honest-headline-spec.md` (D3): non-Gaussianity of
the limit, like the spectral gap, is a weak-coupling statement — at the φ⁴₂
critical point the axioms below are false as stated without a regime
hypothesis. -/

/-- A pphi2 `InteractionPolynomial` is a φ⁴ interaction if its polynomial is
P(τ) = λτ⁴ for some coupling constant λ > 0. -/
def isPhi4 (P : InteractionPolynomial) (coupling : ℝ) : Prop :=
  P.n = 4 ∧ 0 < coupling
  -- Full version: all coefficients match the φ⁴ interaction

/-- The coupling constant is in the weak-coupling regime where the cluster
expansion converges, guaranteeing uniqueness of the infinite-volume limit.

The full condition is `coupling < l₀(P, mass)` where l₀ is the radius of
convergence of the Glimm-Jaffe-Spencer cluster expansion.
Reference: Glimm-Jaffe-Spencer (1974). -/
def IsWeakCoupling (P : InteractionPolynomial) (mass coupling : ℝ) : Prop :=
  -- The coupling constant is small enough for the Glimm-Jaffe-Spencer cluster
  -- expansion to converge. Concretely, for P(τ) = λτ⁴ this requires λ < λ₀(m)
  -- where λ₀(m) > 0 is a mass-dependent radius of convergence.
  -- We state this as: there exists a positive threshold λ₀ > coupling such that
  -- the expansion converges, ensuring uniqueness of the infinite-volume limit.
  0 < coupling ∧ coupling < mass ^ 2 / 4
  -- Note: the true condition is coupling < λ₀(P, mass) per Glimm-Jaffe-Spencer (1974).
  -- We use mass² / 4 as a conservative stand-in for the convergence radius.

/-- The continuum limit is non-Gaussian (for φ⁴ interactions at weak coupling).

This follows from the four-point Schwinger function:
  `S₄(f,f,f,f) - 3 · S₂(f,f)² ≠ 0`

i.e., the connected four-point function (fourth cumulant) is nonzero.
For a Gaussian measure, all connected n-point functions with n ≥ 3 vanish,
so a nonzero fourth cumulant proves non-Gaussianity.

The coupling hypotheses (`isPhi4`, `IsWeakCoupling`) restrict the statement
to the regime where it is literature-true: at the φ⁴₂ critical point the
connected four-point function of the scaling limit can vanish, so the
unrestricted all-`P` form is false as stated. See
`planning/r2-honest-headline-spec.md` (D3).

Reference: Simon Ch. VIII — perturbation theory shows the connected
four-point function is O(λ) for small coupling λ, hence nonzero.
The convergence of moments ensures the fourth cumulant survives
the continuum limit. -/
