# Reflection Positivity Closed Under Weak Limits

Shows that reflection positivity (OS3) is preserved under weak convergence
of measures. This transfers lattice RP to the continuum limit.

## Main results

- `rp_closed_under_weak_limit` — if {μₙ} are RP measures converging weakly
  to μ, then μ is RP

## Mathematical background

RP in the matrix form states: for test functions f₁,...,fₖ supported at
positive time and coefficients c₁,...,cₖ:

  `Σᵢⱼ c̄ᵢ cⱼ ∫ exp(i⟨φ, fᵢ - Θfⱼ⟩) dμ ≥ 0`

Each function `φ ↦ exp(i⟨φ, f⟩)` is bounded and continuous on the
distribution space S'(ℝ²). Therefore:

1. `μₙ ⇀ μ` weakly implies `∫ exp(i⟨φ, f⟩) dμₙ → ∫ exp(i⟨φ, f⟩) dμ`
   for each test function f.

2. Each term `cᵢcⱼ ∫ exp(i⟨φ, fᵢ - Θfⱼ⟩) dμₙ` converges to the
   corresponding term with μ.

3. A finite sum of convergent terms converges: if each partial sum ≥ 0,
   the limit is ≥ 0.

This scalar single-function interface is provable from general principles.
The standard finite-matrix OS3 interface is handled separately in the
P(Φ)₂-specific transfer theorem.

/-! ## Abstract RP for measures on a topological space

We formulate RP abstractly for measures on any measurable space equipped
with a reflection map. -/

variable {X : Type*} [MeasurableSpace X] [TopologicalSpace X]

/-- Abstract reflection positivity condition.

A measure μ on X with reflection Θ : X → X is RP if for all finite
collections of bounded continuous functions Fᵢ supported at "positive time":

  `Σᵢⱼ cᵢ cⱼ ∫ Fᵢ(x) · Fⱼ(Θx) dμ(x) ≥ 0`

We state this for a single function F (the general case follows by
taking F = Σ cᵢ Fᵢ and using bilinearity). -/

/-! ## RP closed under weak limits -/

/-- **RP is closed under weak convergence of measures.**

If `{μₙ}` is a sequence of RP measures on X converging weakly to μ,
then μ is also RP.

Proof:
- For each bounded continuous F:
  `∫ F(x) · F(Θx) dμₙ → ∫ F(x) · F(Θx) dμ`
  by weak convergence (since `x ↦ F(x) · F(Θx)` is bounded continuous
  when F is bounded continuous and Θ is continuous).
- Each term is ≥ 0 by RP of μₙ.
- The limit of nonneg reals is nonneg.

This is a general topological fact that does not depend on the specifics
of the field theory. -/

/-! ## Application to lattice → continuum

When we have:
- Lattice measures μ_a on S'(ℝ²) (via embedding ι_a)
- Each μ_a satisfies RP (from lattice_rp)
- μ_a ⇀ μ weakly (from tightness + Prokhorov)

Then μ satisfies RP by `rp_closed_under_weak_limit`. -/

/-- RP transfers from lattice to continuum limit.

Given a sequence of lattice spacings aₙ → 0 and the corresponding
continuum-embedded measures μ_{aₙ} ⇀ μ, the limit measure μ is RP. -/
