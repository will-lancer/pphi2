/-! ## The interaction polynomial -/

/-- Data for a P(Φ)₂ model: an even polynomial P bounded from below.

The polynomial P(τ) = (1/n)τⁿ + Σ aₘτᵐ has even degree n ≥ 4 and only
even-power terms (odd coefficients vanish). This ensures P(τ) = P(-τ),
giving the Z₂ symmetry φ → -φ that is essential for:
- Reality of the generating functional (Im Z[f] = 0)
- Clustering → ergodicity via Cesàro averaging

/-- Shift the quadratic (τ²) coefficient of P by δ.

Used for mass reparametrization: the total lattice action splits as
½φ·(−Δ+m²)·φ + Σ :P(φ): with the Gaussian contributing m²/2 · τ² to the
quadratic part. Shifting m → m' while setting P → P.shiftQuadratic(m²/2 − m'²/2)
leaves the total action unchanged.

The shifted polynomial remains a valid `InteractionPolynomial`: degree and
leading coefficient are unchanged (n ≥ 4 > 2), and the τ² term is even
so the parity condition is preserved. -/

`evalWick'` keeps the DDJ-facing name for the derivative placeholder. Until
the Wick-ordered derivative is moved into this file, its value is the
derivative of the un-ordered polynomial `P.eval`; callers that need Wick
ordering should use the definitions in `WickPolynomial.lean`.
