# Comprehensive Axiom Audit: pphi2 + gaussian-field + markov-semigroups + gaussian-hilbert

**Last updated**: 2026-08-20.

## 2026-08-20: Part A proof repair and 110-target certificate refresh

* Source commit `7f7b73876704dab85431573bb4ff0373e79bc602` passed the remote
  `lake build` in [CI run 32430497721](https://github.com/will-lancer/pphi2/actions/runs/32430497721).
  [Assurance run 32430497014](https://github.com/will-lancer/pphi2/actions/runs/32430497014)
  also passed its build and sorry-confinement steps and generated the kernel report used here.
* The text source scan reports **27 axiom declarations and 0 sorries**, split into
  **25 public declarations and 2 private scaffolding declarations**. This inventory
  counts declarations. Kernel footprints below count transitive dependencies of named targets.
* `audit/axiom_report.lean` contains **110 unique ordered targets**: five
  `formalization.yaml` main results and 105 regression targets. The generated report has
  110 headers in the same order. Its first five blocks match the earlier headline blocks.
  The proof repair preserved the theorem and axiom declaration inventory.
* `Pphi2.pphi2_existence` depends on exactly five Pphi2 axioms:
  `canonical_continuumMeasure_cf_tendsto`, `continuum_exponential_clustering`,
  `continuum_exponential_moment_bound`, `pphi2_limit_exists`, and
  `rotation_cf_defect_polylog_bound`, together with `propext`, `Classical.choice`,
  and `Quot.sound`.
* `Pphi2.cylinderIso_OS_of_RP_OS2` depends on the upstream axiom
  `GaussianField.embed_l2_uniform_bound`, the Pphi2 project axiom
  `Pphi2.asymInteracting_expMoment_volume_uniform`, and the same Lean trio.
  The theorem is quartic-only and derives RP and OS2 internally.

## 2026-07-14 — Ground-isometry-one bridge PROVED (axiom discharged)

* **`asymGroundStateRep_eq_groundIsometry_one`**
  (`Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymBridgeInstance.lean`) was converted from axiom to theorem with the
  same statement. Proof route: `Lp.ext`/a.e. equality, `groundIsometry_coeFn` for the left
  side, `AEStronglyMeasurable.ae_eq_mk` + `Lp.coeFn_const` for the constant-one
  representative, `ae_withDensity_iff` through
  `groundMeasure ν Ω = ν.withDensity (ENNReal.ofReal (Ω^2))` with the density-nonzero guard
  and the `Ω = 0` branch, then `asymGroundVector_coeFn_eq_groundStateRep` for the right side.
* Kernel footprint (verified 2026-07-14): `#print axioms
  Pphi2.asymGroundStateRep_eq_groundIsometry_one` reports exactly
  `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` — no project axioms, no sorries.
* **Counts:** pphi2 raw axiom count **30 → 29**, 0 sorries (verified
  `./scripts/count_axioms.sh` 2026-07-14).

## 2026-07-13 — Asym normalized-transfer contraction PROVED (axiom discharged)

* **`asymTransferNormalized_contract`** (`Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymBridgeInstance.lean`) was
  converted from axiom to theorem with the same statement. Proof route: decompose
  `f = ⟪Ω,f⟫ • Ω + v`, use `asymTransferNormalized_gap` on `v ⟂ Ω`, preserve
  orthogonality by the packaged self-adjoint normalized transfer, then recombine with
  Pythagoras.
* Kernel footprint (verified 2026-07-13): `#print axioms Pphi2.asymTransferNormalized_contract`
  reports exactly `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` — no project axioms, no sorries.
* **Counts:** pphi2 **31 raw / 29 real → 30 raw / 28 real**, 0 sorries (verified
  `count_axioms.sh` 2026-07-13). First dormant GNS-bridge bookkeeping axiom retired via Codex.

## 2026-07-13 — Torus |f|-form thresholded exp-moment THEOREM landed

* **`asymInteracting_expMoment_volume_uniform_absForm_thresholded`**
  (`Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymCovariancePositivity.lean`) — the torus-level Piece-5 pushforward of
  the lattice `|f|`-form exp-moment bound (`asymInteracting_expMoment_absForm_thresholded`),
  in thresholded form. Kernel footprint (independently verified): trio + the same 6 axioms
  {restated Layer-A `asymInteracting_mgf_gaussianDominated`, the 5 Stage-C axioms}.
* This is the honest restatement target for the legacy torus axiom
  `asymInteracting_expMoment_volume_uniform` (`AsymContinuumLimit.lean:626`); a migration note
  now points its consumers (routeBPrime `hUnif` chain) at the theorem. Counts unchanged
  (31 raw / 29 real / 0 sorries).
* Landed by a Fable-5 agent that ran out of credits during the footprint check; finished and
  committed by the coordinator (Opus 4.8).

## 2026-07-13 — Free-covariance kernel positivity PROVED; |f|-form exp-moment composed (6 axioms)

* **`latticeCovarianceAsymGJ_pairing_nonneg`** (`Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymCovariancePositivity.lean`)
  — entrywise/pairing nonnegativity of the free asym covariance for sitewise-nonneg test
  vectors, proved via a discrete maximum principle (`massOperatorAsym_solution_nonneg`) +
  the spectral Green operator (`asymMassGreen`, `massOperatorAsym_asymMassGreen`). **Bare
  Mathlib trio.** Consequence `asymFreeVariance_posPart_add_negPart_le`
  (`Var(f₊)+Var(f₋) ≤ Var(|f|)`) also proved.
* **`asymInteracting_expMoment_absForm_thresholded`** — the composed lattice exp-moment bound
  `∫e^{|ωf|}dμ_int ≤ 2·exp(2C·Var_free(|f|))`-form under the (a₀, L₀) thresholds: kernel
  footprint = trio + {restated Layer-A `asymInteracting_mgf_gaussianDominated`, the 5
  Stage-C axioms}. This realizes the honest lattice-level CYL-1a content and IS the
  restatement target for the flagged torus axiom `asymInteracting_expMoment_volume_uniform`
  (follow-up: restate that axiom in the |f|/thresholded form and derive it from this
  theorem via the torus pushforward — closing the 2026-07-13 sign-restriction follow-up).
* File finished by the coordinator after two agent infrastructure failures (fixes: an
  already-consumed `Finset.mul_sum` rewrite; `hλ` is an illegal identifier — λ is the
  lambda keyword). Build green (4059 jobs); counts unchanged **31 raw / 29 real / 0 sorries**.

## 2026-07-13 — Layer A `asymInteracting_mgf_gaussianDominated` RESTATED (sign-restricted) + signed-split Layer C landed

* **Restatement (closes the 2026-07-12 red flag):** the Layer A axiom
  (`Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymExpMomentDischarge.lean`) now carries the hypothesis
  `hf : ∀ x, 0 ≤ f x` (sitewise nonnegative), per the 2026-07-12 Gemini 3.1-pro + Codex
  GPT-5.5 verdict that the unrestricted quantifier is FALSE (2-spin mixed-sign
  counterexample; Lebowitz-κ₄ mechanism; n-pair amplification kills the K=2 |·|-form).
  **Rating upgraded: Flagged (FALSE as stated) → Standard (sign-restricted)** — the
  same-sign form is exactly Newman's Thm 3 via Griffiths–Simon/Asano, which both external
  vets confirmed.
* **Signed `f` recovered (the axiom's consumer):** new theorem
  `asymInteracting_expMoment_of_signed` (`Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymSignedSplit.lean`) — the
  vetted `f = f₊ − f₋` split: `|⟨ω,f⟩| ≤ |⟨ω,f₊⟩| + |⟨ω,f₋⟩|`, Cauchy–Schwarz, and the
  restated axiom at `2f₊`/`2f₋`; conclusion
  `∫ e^{|⟨ω,f⟩|} dμ_int ≤ 2·exp(Var_int(f₊) + Var_int(f₋))` — exactly the Codex-refined
  constants of the 2026-07-12 entry (the `2f±` doubling cancels the `½`). Kernel footprint
  (verified `#print axioms` 2026-07-13): trio + the restated axiom only.
* **Layer C assembly reworked:** `asymInteracting_expMoment_volume_uniform_proof` — the
  pre-existing in-repo consumer of the axiom, which fed it a signed `g` — moved from
  `AsymExpMomentDischarge.lean` to `AsymSignedSplit.lean` and is now proved from the split
  lemma + the Layer B2 lattice bound at `g₊`, `g₋`; its seminorm is the **split form**
  `K·exp(C·(Var_free(g₊) + Var_free(g₋)))` (`K = 2`, `C = C_B`). As the 07-12 Codex entry
  warned, `Var_free(g₊) + Var_free(g₋)` is NOT controlled by `Var_free(g)` (cross-term
  cancellation), so the pre-restatement conclusion form `C·Var_free(g)` is not recoverable
  without the entrywise nonnegativity of the free lattice covariance kernel
  (→ `≤ Var_free(|g|)`), which is not formalized — no new axioms in this change. Kernel
  footprint: trio + {restated Layer A, legacy Layer B2 lattice axiom} — the same axiom set
  as before the restatement.
* **Follow-up (torus-level target form):** the separate torus axiom
  `asymInteracting_expMoment_volume_uniform` (`AsymContinuumLimit.lean`, vetted 2026-05-27)
  retains the `C·Var_free(f)` seminorm for signed `f`; the Layer-C discharge now lands at
  the split seminorm, so its eventual discharge needs either the covariance-kernel
  entrywise nonnegativity + an `|f|`-form restatement, or a fresh vet of the
  `C·Var_free(f)` form — tracked for the Layer A campaign
  (`planning/layer-a-lee-yang-scoping.md`).
* **Counts:** unchanged — restatement, not addition (31 raw / 29 real, 0 sorries; verified
  `count_axioms.sh` 2026-07-13). `lake build` green.

## 2026-07-13 — B2 torus-level thresholded variance THEOREM landed (additive Piece-5 migration)

* **New theorem `asymInteractingVariance_le_freeVariance_torus_thresholded`**
  (`Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymVarianceAssembly.lean`): the torus-level interacting ≤ free variance
  bound in the thresholded form (`∃ C L₀ a₀, … ∀ Lt ≥ L₀ … ∀ a ≤ a₀ …`), proved from the
  Stage-C lattice master theorem `…_lattice_thresholded` by the same Piece-5 pushforward
  (`asymTorusInteractingMeasureIso`) + pairing (`asymLatticeTestFnIso`) argument as the legacy
  `asymInteractingVariance_le_freeVariance_Lt_uniform` — but consuming the lattice THEOREM
  instead of the legacy axiom. Kernel footprint (verified `#print axioms` 2026-07-13):
  trio + exactly the 5 Stage-C axioms `{fss_infrared_quadratic, asymTransferGap_uniform_fixedLs,
  asymFinitePeriodicBridge_diagonal_bound, asymFinitePeriodicBridge_remainder_bound_uniform,
  groundVariance_le_freeCovariance}`.
* **Migration note added** to the legacy axiom
  `asymInteractingVariance_le_freeVariance_lattice_Lt_uniform`
  (`Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymExpMomentDischarge.lean`) docstring: it remains only for the legacy
  Layer-C wiring, is over-broad at small `Lt` / coarse `a` (true but unproved there); consumers
  should migrate to the thresholded form (`planning/b2-stageB-holes-spec.md` §C4 design).
* **Count note**: purely additive — no axioms added or removed; counts unchanged
  (31 raw / 29 real, 0 sorries; verified `count_axioms.sh` 2026-07-13).

## 2026-07-12 — S2 `asymTransferGap_uniform_fixedLs` introduced (B2 route (a), with hole B-I)

* **New axiom** `asymTransferGap_uniform_fixedLs`
  (`Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymSliceFamilySusceptibility.lean`): the fixed-`Ls` a-uniform spectral
  gap of the asym transfer operator in **γ-form** — at fixed spatial circumference
  `Ls = Ns·a` there exist `m₀ > 0`, `a₀ > 0` such that for all `(Nt, Ns, a)` with
  `Ns·a = Ls`, `a ≤ a₀`, the normalized transfer contracts by `γ = exp(-m₀·a)` on the
  ground-orthogonal complement. This is §S2 ("17a") of `planning/b2-route-a-statements.md`,
  entered with the coordinator-pinned statement verbatim. The carrier is the PROVED
  operator-norm contraction object (`asymTransferNormalized` / `asymGappedTransfer`'s
  `hnorm` slot), NOT `exp(-a·asymMassGap)`; the coupled `Ns·a = Ls` quantifier is what the
  removed false predecessors (`spectral_gap_uniform`, `spectral_gap_lower_bound`, PR #60)
  lacked.
* **Vetted statement**: Gemini 3.1-pro, 2026-07-12 (§S2 vet record in
  `planning/b2-route-a-statements.md`; `audit/vetting/asymTransferGap_uniform_fixedLs.md`):
  `Nt`-dependence through `wickConstantAsym` is harmless (`wickConstantAsym → c(∞, Ns, a)`
  as `Nt → ∞`; Schrödinger eigenvalues continuous in coefficients; every finite `Nt` has a
  positive gap, so `inf_{Nt} m_gap > 0`). Expert story: `T_a → e^{-aH(Ls)}` in
  compact-resolvent sense (`reflection-positivity/docs/B2_UNIFORMITY_QUESTION.md`,
  Simon *P(φ)₂* Ch. VI).
* **Consumer (proved, same file)**: `asymSliceFamily_pathMeasure_second_moment_le_fixedLs`
  — the `γ := exp(-m₀·a)` specialization of the hole B-I slice-family susceptibility bound
  `asymSliceFamily_pathMeasure_second_moment_le` (steps 1–7 of the Stage-B B-I spec: parity
  mean-zero, path-measure cyclic invariance, off-diagonal two-observable bridge, AM–GM +
  wrap-around geometric sum, Piece-1 substitution, K→∞ DCT transfer), making `2/(1-γ)`
  a-uniformly `≲ 2/(m₀·a)`-controlled at fixed `Ls`.
* **B-I interface note**: the B-I theorem carries two explicitly-named finite-volume
  hypotheses NOT derivable from the landed bricks (no new axioms for them): `hDiag`
  (diagonal one-point ground dominance `∫A_{t,K}(ψ_t)² dμ_path ≤ groundSliceVariance +
  C_diag·γ^Nt` — the single-slice path-measure marginal is `Z⁻¹·kPow(Nt-1)(x,x)·ν ≠ Ω²·ν`
  at finite `Nt`) and `hRes` (a `K`-UNIFORM finite-periodic bridge residual constant — the
  existing axiom `asymFinitePeriodicBridge_remainder_bound` yields a per-contract-pair,
  hence `K`-dependent, constant which the K→∞ engine cannot consume). Both are `γ^Nt`-
  remainder data in the exact shapes their discharge will produce; total remainder
  `(C_diag·Nt + C_off·Nt²)·γ^Nt` feeds the B5b shell's abstract `rem` slot.
* **Rating**: Standard. **Sources**: GR (Gemini 3.1-pro 2026-07-12, §S2 extraction vet),
  LP (Glimm–Jaffe Ch. 6, 19; Simon *P(φ)₂* Ch. VI). Discharge route: norm-resolvent
  convergence of the lattice transfer generator to the spatially cut-off circle
  Hamiltonian `H(Ls)` + continuity of the bottom of the spectrum + per-lattice Jentzsch
  gap for the finite-`a` tail.
* **Count note**: +1 raw/+1 real → 28 raw / 26 real (status.md header + README counter
  updated in the same commit).

## 2026-07-13 — Asym exponential clustering PROVED (2-axiom footprint)

* **`asymSliceObsTrunc_exponential_clustering_fixedLs`**
  (`Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymClustering.lean`, `050236a`): at fixed `Ls`, connected two-point of
  truncated slice observables decays in PHYSICAL distance at the a-uniform rate `m₀` (two-arc
  periodic form + `e^{−m₀(Lt−τ)}` residual tail), with the `√gSV·√gSV'` envelope. Kernel
  footprint (independently re-verified): trio + **only**
  `{asymTransferGap_uniform_fixedLs, asymFinitePeriodicBridge_remainder_bound_uniform}` —
  the GNS packaged-remainder path was bypassed (`finitePeriodicBridgeResidual` is definitional,
  so `|conn| ≤ envelope + residual` is `unfold; ring`; Piece 1 + C2 close the envelope legs).
* This is the honest asym replacement for the removed `clustering_uniform` and the dormant
  square axioms 14/15 (which remain true-but-dead-branch at fixed `(Ns,a)`), and the direct
  lattice input for the eventual cylinder OS4 transfer.

## 2026-07-13 — Phase 4.1: honest ℝ² headline (δ₀ vacuity closed; spec D1–D5)

Implements `planning/r2-honest-headline-spec.md` (design 2026-07-12). Counter delta:
**+1 raw / +1 real → 31 raw / 29 real, 0 sorries** (verified `count_axioms.sh` 2026-07-13;
the +1 is `pphi2_limit_exists`, theorem → axiom; the D4 deletions were theorems, no count
change; `continuumLimit_nonGaussian` and `pphi2_nontriviality` are restatements in place).

* **D1 — `IsPphi2Limit` strengthened (δ₀ vacuity CLOSED).** Appended the coupled-lattice
  conjunct to `IsPphi2Limit` (`Pphi2/ContinuumLimit/Embedding.lean`) and its twin
  `IsPphi2ContinuumLimit` (`Pphi2/Bridge.lean`): `∃ N : ℕ → ℕ`, `N k → ∞`,
  `(N k : ℝ) · a k → ∞`, and `∀ k, ν k = continuumMeasure 2 (N k) P (a k) mass` (with
  `N k ≠ 0`, `0 < a k`, `0 < mass` carried as inner existentials so the `NeZero`/positivity
  plumbing stays inside the conjunct). `P, mass` are now genuinely used; the previous δ₀
  witness (`ν k ≡ dirac 0`) is excluded. 3 mechanical destructure touch-ups
  (`CharacteristicFunctional.lean`, `OS2_WardIdentity.lean` ×2, trailing `_hcoupled`);
  all forwarding consumers unaffected, exactly per the scope doc
  (`planning/ispphi2limit-strengthening-scope.md`).
* **D2 — NEW AXIOM `pphi2_limit_exists`** (`Pphi2/ContinuumLimit/Convergence.lean:325`):
  existence of the infinite-volume P(φ)₂ continuum limit — the δ₀ proof died by D1, replaced
  by ONE clearly-labeled OPEN existence input. Conclusion shape kept as the pre-existing
  `∃ μ (_ : IsProbabilityMeasure μ), IsPphi2Limit μ P mass` (anonymous-constructor form,
  so downstream `obtain ⟨μ, hμ, h_limit⟩` patterns are untouched).
  **Vet record (Gemini 3.1-pro, 2026-07-12) — PASSED with citation correction**: (a) type/
  shape/quantifiers confirmed; (b) strength: NOT Guerra–Rosen–Simon — GKS/FKG monotonicity
  fails for general even deg ≥ 6 multi-well P (Ellis–Monroe–Newman, CMP 46 (1976)); cited
  route is Fröhlich, Adv. Math. 23 (1976) + Y.M. Park, J. Math. Phys. 18 (1977) (volume- and
  spacing-uniform lattice moment bounds via lattice Nelson symmetry/checkerboard), which
  covers the full InteractionPolynomial class at all couplings; (c) non-vacuous; (d)
  hypotheses sufficient. **Rating: Standard. Sources: GR, LP.** Discharge route: cylinder
  campaign M2–M4 + keystone 18 (`docs/cylinder-master-plan.md`). Marked (NOT VERIFIED —
  statement Gemini-vetted 2026-07-12) pending a full proof.
* **D3 (partial) — regime hypotheses threaded into `continuumLimit_nonGaussian`**
  (`Convergence.lean:293`): added `(coupling : ℝ) (hP4 : isPhi4 P coupling)
  (hweak : IsWeakCoupling P mass coupling)` — the unrestricted all-`P` form is false at the
  φ⁴₂ critical point. `isPhi4` / `IsWeakCoupling` moved upstream from `Bridge.lean` to
  `Convergence.lean` (same `Pphi2` namespace ascent keeps Bridge call sites working).
  Consumers `pphi2_nonGaussianity` / `pphi2_nonGaussian` (`Main.lean`) carry the same
  hypotheses. The spectral-gap axioms named in spec D3 were already removed 2026-07-12.
* **D4 — reparametrization artifacts DELETED**: `mass_reparametrization_invariance`
  (`:= h_limit`, a vacuity artifact) and `mass_reparametrization_exists` (both theorems, no
  proof-term consumers — verified by grep). Statements + strategy recorded in `docs/plan.md`
  § "Deferred consistency checks".
* **D5 — headline restatements**: `pphi2_existence` docstring now names its inputs explicitly
  (existence = `pphi2_limit_exists`; OS = the 4 inheritance axioms
  `continuum_exponential_moment_bound`, `canonical_continuumMeasure_cf_tendsto`,
  `continuum_exponential_clustering`, `rotation_cf_defect_polylog_bound`; interaction/
  nondegeneracy separate pending keystone 18 → `planning/coherence-analysis.md`).
  `pphi2_nontriviality` (`Main.lean:158`) RESTATED in the about-the-limit form
  `IsPphi2Limit μ P mass → ∀ f ≠ 0, 0 < ∫ (ω f)² ∂μ` — with D1 this is a true statement
  about the real coupled limit (δ₀ gone). Kept as axiom; Rating: Standard (GRS two-point
  lower bound, Simon Ch. V), (NOT VERIFIED). `pphi2_nontrivial` re-derived via
  `pphi2_limit_exists`.
* **Kernel footprint of the headline**: `#print axioms Pphi2.pphi2_existence` = trio +
  {`pphi2_limit_exists`, `continuum_exponential_moment_bound`,
  `canonical_continuumMeasure_cf_tendsto`, `continuum_exponential_clustering`,
  `rotation_cf_defect_polylog_bound`} — grew 4 → 5 project axioms; **that is the honest
  count** (the previous 4 was purchased by the δ₀ witness).

## 2026-07-13 — B2 STAGE C COMPLETE: the thresholded variance bound is a THEOREM on 5 vetted axioms

* **`asymInteractingVariance_le_freeVariance_lattice_thresholded`**
  (`Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymVarianceAssembly.lean`, commit `081ef48`): at fixed `Ls`, there are
  `C, L₀, a₀ > 0` with `Var_int(ωG) ≤ C·Var_free(ωG)` for ALL `G` and all lattices with
  `Ns·a = Ls`, `a ≤ a₀`, `Nt·a ≥ L₀`. Kernel footprint (independently re-verified):
  `[trio] + {fss_infrared_quadratic, asymTransferGap_uniform_fixedLs,
  asymFinitePeriodicBridge_diagonal_bound, asymFinitePeriodicBridge_remainder_bound_uniform,
  groundVariance_le_freeCovariance}` — the B3/GNS/measure-factorization chain contributes
  nothing beyond these five vetted (GR+LP) axioms.
* **Route recap** (all 2026-07-12/13, `planning/b2-route-a-statements.md` +
  `planning/b2-stageB-holes-spec.md`): mode-split design (FSS high branch ⊕ gap band branch)
  after the design-pass verdict killed the oscillation-blind chain; S4 spectral toolkit;
  S1 integrated-form FSS + proved high branch; Stage A slice-average characterization;
  B-II band free comparison (honest zero-mode constant); B-I slice-family susceptibility
  (parity + cyclic invariance proved; τ-form IUC bridge axioms with the fixed-physical-time
  structure); C1 band-limitedness; C2 hInt discharged via ground-vector Gaussian-decay
  smoothing (bare trio); C3 per-pair Cauchy–Schwarz sharp remainder; C4 assembly with the
  pinned a-cancellations (`(2/(1−γ))·(2a/m)` etc.).
* **Remaining for full B2 closure (wiring, owner-flagged)**: migrate Piece-5 / Layer C to the
  thresholded (eventual-in-`Lt,a`) form; then the original all-`(Lt,a)` axiom
  `asymInteractingVariance_le_freeVariance_lattice_Lt_uniform` (over-broad: true-but-unproved
  at small `Lt` / coarse `a`) can be deleted or restated. Clustering axioms 14/15 ride the
  same trace bridge next (`planning/cyl-2a-spectral-gap.md`).

## 2026-07-12 — τ-form revision of the K-uniform bridge axioms (statements strengthened in place)

* `asymFinitePeriodicBridge_remainder_bound_uniform` and `_diagonal_bound` restated in the
  **τ-form** (fixed physical reference time; `2τ ≤ Nt·a` proviso): constants now depend only
  on `(P, mass, Ls, τ)` — **a-uniform at fixed `Ls`** — with damping `γ^(Nt − ⌈τ/a⌉)` and
  explicit `√groundSliceVariance` observable factors. Two-step vet (Gemini 3.1-pro,
  2026-07-12): (i) the per-step IUC constant blows up as `a → 0` (short-time kernel), so the
  previous per-instance form was implicitly a-divergent; (ii) the τ-form with HS
  Cauchy–Schwarz splitting (operator norm on short arcs, IUC only across a fixed-τ window,
  `γ^{−⌈τ/a⌉} = e^{m₀τ}` at the S2 gap) is exact — full proof blueprint recorded in
  `planning/b2-stageB-holes-spec.md` §"Item-1 upgrade". This RESOLVES Stage-C design
  question #1 (the `a → 0` remainder corner): remainder/main ≈ `C·Lt·m₀·e^{−m₀(Lt−τ)}`,
  bounded in `a`, decaying in `Lt`.
* Consumers rederived: `asymSliceFamily_pathMeasure_second_moment_le'` and `…_fixedLs'`
  (τ-form, `gSVSum`-unit remainders); the two core B-I theorems generalized to an abstract
  remainder slot `R` (no proof change — `γ^Nt` was already opaque). Counts unchanged
  (30 raw / 28 real). Small-`Lt` regime (`Nt·a < 2τ`) deferred to Stage C explicitly.

## 2026-07-12 — K-uniform finite-periodic bridge axioms (B-I cleanup; +2)

* **New axioms (2)** in `Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymSliceFamilySusceptibility.lean`:
  `asymFinitePeriodicBridge_remainder_bound_uniform` (K-uniform family form of the GNS
  remainder — the per-contract `asymFinitePeriodicBridge_remainder_bound` allows `C_rem` to
  depend on `‖A_K‖_∞`, hence on `K`, which blocks the K→∞ dominated-convergence step) and
  `asymFinitePeriodicBridge_diagonal_bound` (single-slice marginal has density
  `Z⁻¹·kPow(Nt−1)(x,x)`, not `Ω²` — the `O(γ^Nt)` correction, K-uniform).
* **Vetting (statement level, Gemini 3.1-pro 2026-07-12)**: intrinsic ultracontractivity
  `T(x,y) ≤ C·Ω(x)Ω(y)` reduces all residual/diagonal trace terms to Ω-weighted `L¹/L²`
  data, so the clamp domination `|A_K| ≤ |⟨g,·⟩|` transfers with no `‖A‖_∞` penalty.
  Constants may depend on `(a, Ls)` — NOT claimed a-uniform (the `a→0` corner is Stage-C
  design question #1, `planning/b2-stageB-holes-spec.md`). Rating: **Standard** /
  Sources: GR, LP (IUC for Schrödinger semigroups with confining potentials — Davies–Simon;
  GJ trace bounds). Old per-contract axiom retained (supersession note added) for the
  finite-K bridge theorems; all three collapse in the trace-bridge discharge.
* **Consumers (proved, same commit)**: `asymSliceFamily_pathMeasure_second_moment_le'`
  (hypothesis-free hole B-I) and `asymSliceFamily_pathMeasure_second_moment_le_fixedLs'`
  (S2-specialized, hypothesis-free).
* **Counts**: pphi2 28 raw / 26 real → **30 raw / 28 real**, 0 sorries.

## 2026-07-12 — S1 `fss_infrared_quadratic` introduced (B2 route (a))

* **New axiom** `fss_infrared_quadratic` (`Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymInfraredBound.lean`): the
  Fröhlich–Simon–Spencer infrared bound / Gaussian domination in **integrated quadratic
  form** — on the zero-mode complement (`∑ x, h x = 0`) the interacting second moment is
  dominated by the massless free quadratic form `(a²)⁻¹·Σ_k (λ_k − m²)⁻¹·c_k(h)²`,
  uniformly in `(a, Nt, Ns)` and at all couplings. This is §S1 of
  `planning/b2-route-a-statements.md` (the B2 route (a) statement package), entered with
  the coordinator-pinned statement verbatim.
* **Vetted statement**: Gemini 3.1-pro, 2026-07-12 — constant `c₀ = 1` is EXACT in this GJ
  normalization (kinetic action `½⟨φ,(−Δ_unscaled)φ⟩`, β = ½; mass and Wick terms live in
  the single-site factor and never enter the denominator). See the §S1 vet record in
  `planning/b2-route-a-statements.md` and `audit/vetting/fss_infrared_quadratic.md`.
* **Consumer (proved, same file)**: `asymHighModes_variance_le_freeVariance` — the
  high-branch comparison `Var_int(P_S G) ≤ (1 + m²/κ²)·Var_free(P_S G)` for mode sets `S`
  with `m² + κ² ≤ λ_k`, via the proved zero-mode-complement lemma
  `sum_asymModeProj_eq_zero` (constants are `m²`-eigenvectors; nonconstant eigenvectors
  sum to zero by self-adjointness).
* **Rating**: Standard. **Sources**: GR (Gemini 3.1-pro 2026-07-12), LP
  (Fröhlich–Simon–Spencer, Comm. Math. Phys. 50 (1976) 79–95; Simon *P(φ)₂*; Glimm–Jaffe).
  Discharge route: lattice RP over the kinetic bonds → Gaussian domination
  `Z[h] ≤ Z[0]·exp(½⟨h,(−Δ)⁻¹h⟩)` → `t²`-expansion at the Z₂-even measure (shares the
  Griffiths–Simon machinery with Layer A).
* **Count note**: +1 raw/+1 real on this branch; full count reconciliation deferred until
  PR #60 merges (the removal branch changes the same counters).

## 2026-07-12 — ⚠⚠ `spectral_gap_uniform` + `spectral_gap_lower_bound` are FALSE as stated

* **Finding (hand computation + Gemini 3.1-pro verification + consumer trace, 2026-07-12):**
  both axioms (`TransferMatrix/SpectralGap.lean:89,100`) are stated at **fixed `Ns`** with
  `a → 0` — a shrinking-volume limit in which the hard-coded 2D Wick constant is the *wrong*
  counterterm: its zero-mode contribution `(a²N²m²)⁻¹` diverges like `a⁻²` (in the coupled
  `N·a = L` limit it is the finite `m⁻²/L²`). The over-subtraction gives the spatial zero mode
  a symmetric double well (minima `~ a⁻¹`, barrier `~ a⁻³`); the gap is a tunneling splitting
  `massGap ~ (1/a)·e^{−c/a²} → 0`. This falsifies `∃ m₀ > 0` uniformly in `a` at **every**
  coupling (every `InteractionPolynomial` has leading coefficient `1/n > 0`) — a different and
  earlier failure than the known criticality caveat. **Rating: FALSE (was ⚠ Correct for P(Φ)₂).**
* **Mitigation:** proof-term trace confirms both axioms and the entire lattice OS4 chain
  (`two_point_clustering_lattice`, `general_clustering_lattice`, `clustering_uniform`,
  `os4_lattice`, `exponential_mixing`) are a **dead branch** — zero external consumers; Main's
  OS4 rests on the standalone `continuum_exponential_clustering`. The headline kernel trace is
  uncontaminated. Nevertheless false axioms in the build are a standing soundness hazard.
* **Action required (soon, small PR):** delete or restate along a coupled sequence
  (fixed `L = N·a`, or `N·a → ∞` + `IsWeakCoupling`), per
  `planning/cyl-2a-volume-scaling-addendum.md` (17a/17b split). The fixed-`(Ns,a)` clustering
  axioms 14/15 are unaffected (they don't take the `a→0` limit).

## 2026-07-12 — ⚠ Layer A axiom `asymInteracting_mgf_gaussianDominated` OVER-QUANTIFIED

**RESOLVED 2026-07-13 — restated** (hypothesis `∀ x, 0 ≤ f x` added; signed-split lemma
landed as its consumer in `AsymSignedSplit.lean`; rating Flagged → Standard
(sign-restricted) — see the 2026-07-13 entry above).

* **Flag (Gemini 3.1-pro vet of the Layer-A scoping, 2026-07-12; arithmetic verified by hand):**
  the axiom (`Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymExpMomentDischarge.lean:127`) quantifies over **all**
  `f : AsymLatticeField Nt Ns`, but Newman/Lee–Yang Gaussian domination requires **same-sign**
  coefficients. Counterexample mechanism: 2-spin ferromagnet, `S = σ₁ − σ₂` — the `t⁴`
  comparison fails for `J > ½·log 2`; equivalently, mixed-sign `fᵢfⱼfₖfₗ` against
  Lebowitz-negative `u₄` makes `κ₄(⟨ω,f⟩) > 0`. The 2026-06-02 vet confirmed the K=2/Var form
  but not the quantifier. **Rating downgraded: Likely correct → Flagged (over-quantified).**
* **Fix path** (campaign PR, see `planning/layer-a-lee-yang-scoping.md`): add sitewise `0 ≤ f`
  to the axiom; recover signed `f` in Layer C via the `f = f₊ − f₋` split + Cauchy–Schwarz
  (constants change to `K = 2`, variance `2(Var f₊ + Var f₋)` — compatible with the Layer C
  target form). Downstream Layer C consumers must NOT feed signed `f` into Layer A directly.
* **Codex second opinion (GPT-5.5, 2026-07-12): CONFIRMED on all points** — arithmetic verified;
  Newman/Lee–Yang literature requires same-sign coefficients; the axiom is **positively false
  for the P(φ)₂ class** (deep double-well single-site concentration → Ising reduction; Wick
  ordering cannot repair it), and its `K = 2` absolute-value form falls to amplification
  (`n` mixed-sign pairs: `n·log(1+p(cosh 2 − 1)) > n·2p + log 2`). Refined fix constants:
  the `f = f₊ − f₋` split with Cauchy–Schwarz + Newman at `2f±` gives
  `E e^{|⟨ω,f⟩|} ≤ 2·exp(Var(f₊) + Var(f₋))` (NOT half that — the `2f±` doubling cancels the
  `½`). ⚠ Downstream: `V_free(f₊) + V_free(f₋)` is NOT controlled by `V_free(f)` (cross-term
  cancellation); state the Layer C seminorm at `|f|` — sound since the free lattice covariance
  kernel is entrywise ≥ 0 (random walk), so `V(f₊) + V(f₋) ≤ V(|f|)`. Rating stays
  **Flagged (FALSE as stated)**; restatement in the campaign PR.

## 2026-07-12 — Upstream Nelson/hypercontractivity chain is axiom-free (kernel-verified)

* **Finding (Phase 1 of `planning/completion-plan-2026-07.md`):** at pphi2's current pins
  (gaussian-hilbert `56ee09f` = its main HEAD; markov-semigroups `acf6491`), `#print axioms`
  yields exactly `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` for
  `GaussianHilbert.ouSemigroupAct_eLpNorm_hypercontractive`,
  `GaussianHilbert.bonami_nelson_chaos`, and
  `GaussianHilbert.polynomial_chaos_concentration`. The whole
  hypercontractivity → chaos-concentration chain feeding pphi2's `NelsonEstimate/` is
  **theorem-backed upstream**; the Gross step routes through markov-semigroups' proved
  `gross_lsi_implies_hypercontractive_of_hypotheses`
  (`Instances/WorkInProgress/EuclideanHypercontractive.lean:482`), not the legacy axiom
  `gross_lsi_implies_hypercontractive` (`Abstract/Hypercontractivity.lean:648`), and the
  Concentration axioms (`herbst_mgf_bound`, `poincare_of_lsi`) are not in the closure.
* **Consequence for the tables below:** the "gaussian-hilbert 1 axiom
  (`ouSemigroupAct_eLpNorm_hypercontractive`)" row and the markov-semigroups "11 axioms"
  row overstate the *load-bearing* debt for pphi2's Nelson chain — the remaining
  markov-semigroups axioms (16 raw on main, incl. legacy Gross/Stroock–Varopoulos,
  Herbst, DZ, matrix) are dormant for this chain. Cross-checked against
  `random-fields/RandomFields` `Instances/OUDiffusion`, whose
  `gaussian_{hypercontractive,lp_improvement,chaos_hypercontractive}` are independently
  kernel-verified axiom-free (same DirichletMarkovSemigroup lineage).
* **Stale-doc flag:** gaussian-hilbert `HypercontractivityFromBE.lean:21–46` ("inherits four
  non-core axioms") predates the markov-semigroups discharges and needs updating in that repo;
  likewise RandomFields `GrossODE.lean` carries "documented `sorry`" status prose over
  now-complete proofs.
## 2026-07-12 — `spectral_gap_uniform` + `spectral_gap_lower_bound` REMOVED (false as stated)

* **Finding (hand computation + Gemini 3.1-pro verification + proof-term consumer trace):**
  both axioms (`TransferMatrix/SpectralGap.lean`) asserted an `a`-uniform gap lower bound at
  **fixed `Ns`** — a shrinking-volume limit (`Ns·a → 0`) in which the hard-coded 2D Wick
  constant is the wrong counterterm: its zero-mode contribution `(a²Ns²m²)⁻¹` diverges like
  `a⁻²` (in the coupled `N·a = L` limit it is the finite `m⁻²/L²`). The over-subtraction gives
  the spatial zero mode a symmetric double well (minima `~ a⁻¹`, barrier `~ a⁻³`); the gap is
  the tunneling splitting `massGap ~ (1/a)·e^{−c/a²} → 0`, at **every** coupling (every
  `InteractionPolynomial` has leading coefficient `1/n > 0`). This is a different and earlier
  failure than the known criticality caveat. **Rating: FALSE (was ⚠ Correct for P(Φ)₂,
  Gemini 2026-03-07 — that vet addressed the physics of the coupled limit, not the fixed-`Ns`
  quantifier).**
* **Removal:** both axioms deleted, together with their sole term-consumer `clustering_uniform`
  (`OSProofs/OS4_MassGap.lean` — a literal restatement). The trace confirms the rest of the
  lattice OS4 chain and Main's OS4 never consumed them (`continuum_exponential_clustering`
  carries OS4), so no downstream proof changes. Live docstring references updated
  (`AxiomInheritance.lean`, `OS2_WardIdentity.lean`).
* **Replacement policy (per the no-consumer precedent):** the corrected statement — the gap
  along a *coupled* sequence (fixed `L = N·a`, no regime hypothesis; or `N·a → ∞` under
  `IsWeakCoupling`) — is recorded with its discharge route in
  `planning/cyl-2a-volume-scaling-addendum.md` (17a/17b split) and will enter the build only
  with its consumer (the OS4 campaign).
* **Counts:** pphi2 **28 raw / 26 real → 26 raw / 24 real**, 0 sorries. `lake build` green
  (4038 jobs). The fixed-`(Ns,a)` clustering axioms 14/15 are unaffected.

## 2026-06-23 — Layer-B2 Piece 5 torus assembly landed

* **Axiom-to-theorem conversion:** `asymInteractingVariance_le_freeVariance_Lt_uniform`
  in `Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymExpMomentDischarge.lean` is now a theorem. The proof is
  the final torus assembly: pull `asymTorusInteractingMeasureIso` back as
  `(interactingLatticeMeasureAsym).map asymTorusEmbedLiftIso`, rewrite
  `(asymTorusEmbedLiftIso ω) f` as `ω (asymLatticeTestFnIso f)`, and apply the
  lattice Route-A bound.
* **Remaining active input:** the analytic debt is factored to the narrower lattice
  axiom `asymInteractingVariance_le_freeVariance_lattice_Lt_uniform`. This is the
  lattice-level final Route-A assembly target; it is where Piece 4's
  `interacting_second_moment_bound_to_lattice_free_covariance`, the finite-K
  time-family estimate, the `K → ∞` packaging, and the free-side assembly must close.
* **Counts:** pphi2 is now **28 raw / 26 real axioms**, 0 sorries. The raw count
  dropped by removing the stale `AsymExpMomentDischarge.lean` docstring false
  positive; the real count is unchanged because the torus axiom was replaced by the
  narrower lattice input rather than fully proved axiom-free.

## 2026-06-23 — Layer-B2 Route-A GNS bridge instantiated for asym transfer

* **New bridge file:** `Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymBridgeInstance.lean` wires Piece 1's
  `asymSliceObsTruncContract` into the upstream
  `ReflectionPositivity` finite-periodic path-measure GNS bridge. It provides
  `asymGroundSemigroupData`, `asymGroundGapData`,
  `asymRemainderHypothesis`, finite-K connected two-point/susceptibility
  bounds, the Piece-1 integral norm substitution, and the torus second-moment
  path-measure handoff.
* **New axioms (6):** `asymGroundStateRep_pos_ae`,
  `asymTransferNormalized_contract`, `asymGroundStateRep_eq_groundIsometry_one`,
  `asymGroundSemigroup_intertwines`, `asymPartition_ground_bound`, and
  `asymFinitePeriodicBridge_remainder_bound`. Each has a docstring discharge
  plan in the Lean file and a per-axiom vetting record under `audit/vetting/`.
* **Counts:** pphi2 was **29 raw / 26 real axioms**, 0 sorries. The raw →
  real reconciliation had 3 docstring matches at that point; the new bridge
  axioms are all real architectural debt. `lake build` is green.

## 2026-06-23 — Layer-B2 Piece 4 B5b single-slice interface landed

* **New file:** `Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymB5bSingleSlice.lean` adds the one-slice
  free covariance bookkeeping, the `freeSingleSliceCovariance_smul` a-power
  audit, summed B5b wrappers, and the Piece-3 handoff lemmas.
* **New axiom (1):** `groundVariance_le_freeCovariance`, the narrow analytic
  B5b input: fixed-`Ls` ground-state slice variance is bounded by the matching
  one-slice free GJ covariance uniformly in `a`, `Nt`, and the slice.
* **Discharge record:** `audit/vetting/groundVariance_le_freeCovariance.md`.
  The later free-side assembly to full spacetime free variance remains an
  explicit hypothesis in the Lean theorem to avoid the known standalone
  `1/(1-γ)` a-nonuniform shortcut.

## 2026-06-21 — `torus_weakCoupling_lattice_connectedFourPoint_strictNeg` removed; `audit/` scaffold landed

* **Axiom removed.** The `torus_weakCoupling_lattice_connectedFourPoint_strictNeg`
  axiom (`Pphi2/TorusContinuumLimit/TorusInteractingResult.lean`, added 2026-06-05)
  and its sole consumer theorem `torus_pphi2_isInteracting_weakCoupling` were
  **deleted on 2026-06-21**. Both were superseded by Route A's
  `torus_pphi2_isInteractingStrict_weakCoupling` (PR #48,
  branch `route-a-weak-coupling`, **open** — discharges the same content
  axiom-free via the coupling-family continuum limit + 4-homogeneity). The
  carrier file `TorusInteractingResult.lean` and its `import` in `Pphi2.lean`
  were removed in the same commit. Build remains green (4024/4024).
* **Counts:** pphi2 was 23 raw / 20 real → now **22 raw / 19 real** (the 3
  docstring matches in `LatticeBridge.lean:21`, `LayerCake.lean:85`, and
  `AsymExpMomentDischarge.lean:244` account for the raw → real reconciliation).
  19 real = 17 architectural (per `planning/INDEX.md` items 1–17) + 2 private
  scaffolding (`asymTorusInteracting_exponentialMomentBound`,
  `gaussian_rp_cov_perfect_square`).
* **`audit/` directory scaffolded** per
  [`math-commons/formalization-assurance`](https://github.com/math-commons/formalization-assurance)
  ADOPTION.md conventions: `audit/CONVENTIONS.md` (local settings),
  `audit/axiom_report.lean` (generator) + `audit/axiom-report.txt` (golden
  kernel trace), `audit/FAITHFULNESS.md` (informal↔formal correspondence),
  `audit/VALIDATION.md` (acceptance ladder — pphi2 sits at rung 2),
  `audit/vetting/` (per-axiom records, **19/19 covered**),
  `audit/sorry-allowlist.txt` (6 entries — pre-existing scaffolding under
  `ddj/` and `future/CylinderContinuumLimit/` flagged by the gate),
  `.github/workflows/assurance.yml` (caller of the hub's shared workflow).
  Strictness is **L1** (warn-only); the gate runs green on every push/PR.
* **Notable kernel-trace finding** (`audit/axiom-report.txt`):
  `Pphi2.pphi2_existence` rests on only **4 project axioms**
  (`canonical_continuumMeasure_cf_tendsto`, `continuum_exponential_clustering`,
  `continuum_exponential_moment_bound`, `rotation_cf_defect_polylog_bound`)
  plus the 3 Lean kernel axioms. The other 13 architectural axioms are
  dormant for this headline — load-bearing only for cylinder OS3,
  non-Gaussianity, or two-point nondegeneracy.

## 2026-06-02 — Layer B2 transfer-matrix spectral gap PROVED; discharge plan refined (no chessboard)

Operator side of the Layer-B2 (`asymInteractingVariance_le_freeVariance_Lt_uniform`)
discharge is now built and sorry/axiom-free:

* `reflection-positivity` (now a dep of pphi2, v4.30.0): `GappedTransfer` +
  `GappedTransfer.susceptibility_le` (the `Lt`-uniform two-point-sum bound via
  the geometric series).
* `Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymGappedTransfer.lean` + `AsymSpectralGap.lean`:
  `asymTransferNormalized_gap` (operator-norm gap on the ground-orthogonal
  complement) and `asymGappedTransfer'` (hypothesis-free `GappedTransfer`).
* Prereq fix: `AsymTransferGroundExcitedData.htop` re-exposes jentzsch's
  Perron-Frobenius dominance — the ground index was under-specified.

**Framing correction.** The chessboard / FSS framing in the discharge plans of
both `asymInteractingVariance_le_freeVariance_Lt_uniform` and
`asymInteracting_expMoment_volume_uniform` (this file, the per-axiom table, and
the axiom docstrings) is **SUPERSEDED**: at fixed `Ls` the cylinder mass gap is
uniform via compact-resolvent convergence (`T_a → e^{−aH(Ls)}`, Simon Ch. VI),
so **no chessboard is needed** (FSS is only for the thermodynamic `Ls → ∞`
limit). See `reflection-positivity/docs/B2_UNIFORMITY_QUESTION.md` (expert-vetted).

**Refined discharge plan** (`docs/layer-B2-discharge-plan.md`): a Källén-Lehmann/
Feynman-Kac trace representation (the un-formalized measure↔operator bridge, a
*more-fundamental* axiom-to-be replacing the high-level B2 axiom) + the int/free
comparison via the proved gap. The operator-theoretic content (gap, geometric
series) that was historically the hard part is now proved.

**Codex vetting (2026-06-02): the naive 3-piece form is FLAWED but salvageable.**
Corrections folded into the plan doc: (i) the interacting representation must be
the periodic **two-arc trace** `⟨A Tᵗ A T^{Lt−t}⟩/⟨T^{Lt}⟩` (corollary factor
`γ^r + γ^{Nt−r}`), not a single-`dist` kernel equality; (ii) the scalar free
lower bound `Var_free ≳ 1/(1−γ_free)·Σ‖Q‖²` is likely FALSE for high temporal
modes — replace with **mode-by-mode free-covariance domination**; (iii)
`susceptibility_le` is single-vector, so a **cyclic Young** lemma is needed for
the double sum; (iv) add a **Z₂ zero-mean** lemma (raw vs connected 2nd moment);
(v) reconcile the GJ `a`-weight to avoid double-counting; (vi) add the fixed-`Ls`
gap-convergence `m_a → m(Ls) > 0` as an explicit input. See the plan doc's
"⚠ Vetting result" section.

**Second vetting (Gemini 3.1-pro, 2026-06-02): even the corrected plan is
STRUCTURALLY flawed.** The target compares to `Var_free` (an `H⁻¹` space-*time*
Sobolev norm); the transfer-matrix route yields only a *time* gap × *spatial `L²`*
norm, and `L² ⊄ H⁻¹` — a 1D time gap cannot bound a 2D Sobolev norm (NORM
MISMATCH; no spatial control). Codex's "mode-by-mode domination" fix is *false*
(bare mass `m₀² → −∞` under Wick ordering; Brascamp–Lieb loses log-concavity).
Salvage: **Nelson symmetry** to bridge space↔time (the alternative to chessboard),
and/or combine B1's existing Nelson norm-match (per-`Lt`) with the TM gap for
`Lt`-uniformity — NOT a direct `Var_int`-as-TM-sum vs `Var_free` comparison.
**Open nuance:** whether `‖Q_s‖²` is raw spatial `L²` or already carries spatial
covariance (physical/`B`-inner product) decides whether the objection bites — pin
this before writing any representation axiom. **Decision: do not introduce the
representation axiom until this is settled.**

**Step-B design vetted (Gemini 3.1, 2026-06-02; superseded 2026-06-03).** First pinned
the relative form bound `H_free ≤ C·H_int + c₂` (GJ Ch. 9). DEAD END recorded: the
spectral-MEASURE domination `ρ_int ≤ C·ρ_free` is FALSE (`ρ_int`, `ρ_free` mutually
singular — interaction shifts the mass pole + adds a multi-particle continuum).

**Step-B atom (Gemini deep-think, 2026-06-03): FSS infrared bound** — ranked #1 of
A/B/C for the general "interacting ≤ free two-point, uniform" question
(`⟨φ̂(k)φ̂(−k)⟩_int ≤ 1/(2E(k))`, `k≠0`; applies to φ⁴₂ via lattice RP; `a`/`Lt`-uniform;
immune to the Wick negative bare mass). DEAD ENDS confirmed: Brascamp–Lieb (non-convex
Wick double well), `ρ_int ≤ C·ρ_free` (mutually singular). Fallback: GJ Ch. 9 form
bound (continuum/cutoff ⇒ lattice impedance mismatch).

**CORRECTION (2026-06-03, code map): FSS is NOT for B2 — it is parked for `Ls→∞`.**
Reading the code (`AsymExpMomentDischarge.lean:206` + no Fourier layer in pphi2):
B2 fixes `Ls`, sends `Lt→∞`, so the spatial infrared FSS controls is gapped by the
box (`|k_s|≥2π/Ls`); the dangerous direction is time, owned by the **proved gap**
(`susceptibility_le`), with **B1** owning the `a→0` UV uniformity. So **B2 = B1 ⊕ gap
⊕ the Feynman–Kac measure↔operator bridge** — no new textbook axiom. The bridge is the
deferred `transfer-operator-construction-todo`, scoped in
`docs/layer-B2-discharge-plan.md` → "Feynman–Kac bridge — scoping". FSS's vetted
statement + citation + drop-in Lean signature saved in `docs/fss-infrared-bound-spec.md`
for the eventual `Ls→∞` step; **not added as an `axiom`** (no consumer; needs a Fourier
layer). No new axioms enter the build from this round.

**Transfer-instantiation axiom vetting (Gemini 3.1-pro, 2026-06-03).** Considered two
textbook helper axioms to discharge the `Pphi2AsymTTS` `TimeTranslatedSystem` sorries:
- `Pphi2Asym_reflectionPositive` (asym lattice OS3 RP in abstract form): **vetted GREEN**
  — correct, non-vacuous, dischargeable by porting the square `lattice_rp` + a density
  adapter; asym `Nt≠Ns` is the same proof. Sources `GR` (Gemini), `LP` (GJ Ch 6.1 /
  Simon III.3). Rating **Standard**. NOT YET in the build (held pending the reframe below).
- A reflection-seminorm contraction axiom: **REJECTED — ill-posed.** Root cause: on a
  finite PERIODIC torus the `τPos` field (positive-time preserved by the unit shift) is
  FALSE (a strict half-region `{0<t<Nt/2}` is not shift-stable), so the transfer operator
  `T:[f]↦[f∘τ]` is not well-defined on `H_phys`. ⟹ the finite-torus GNS `TimeTranslatedSystem`
  instance is UNSOUND, not merely incomplete. Reframe required: (A) infinite cylinder
  `Nt→∞` (positive-time `{t>0}`, B2's regime), or (B) the explicit slice transfer matrix
  on `L²(ℝ^Ns)` (= pphi2's existing `asymTransferOperatorCLM` + gap). See
  `docs/transfer-instantiation-plan.md` → "AXIOM VETTING".

**Impact on counts**: no change yet (no axiom added or removed; B2 stays an axiom
pending the Piece-1 representation axiom + the Piece-2/3 proofs).

## 2026-05-31 — Layer B1 (cylinder TM + variance bound) complete

The cylinder transfer-matrix port for the `asymInteracting_expMoment_volume_uniform`
discharge architecture is complete (4 phases, ~1000 lines):

* **Phase 1** (commit `ec3a6f4`): `Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymL2Operator.lean` —
  asym cylinder transfer operator definition, compactness, self-adjointness.
* **Phase 2** (`bce8c1e`): `AsymJentzsch.lean` — positivity-improving +
  strictly PD + ground simple + spectral decomposition.
* **Phase 3** (`2541f9c`): `AsymPositivity.lean` — energy levels +
  `asymMassGap_pos`.
* **Phase 4** (`8ca0f5c`): `AsymVarianceBound.lean` — Layer B1 variance
  bound `Var_int(⟨ω,f⟩) ≤ C(Lt,Ls) · Var_free(⟨ω,f⟩)` uniform in
  `(Nt, Ns, a)` at fixed `(Lt, Ls)`.

Phase 4 discovery: `asymTorusIso_interacting_second_moment_density_transfer`
in `AsymContinuumLimit.lean` ALREADY proves the variance bound via
density-transfer + Gaussian-4th-moment + Nelson exp-moment (now
unconditional after UNIT 7). Phases 1-3's transfer-matrix machinery is
the **foundation for Layer B2** (Lt-uniformity, deferred — shares
discharge path with the square's open `spectral_gap_uniform`).

**Impact on counts**: no change — Layer B1 is infrastructure for the
remaining axiom, which is still an axiom (pending Layers A + B2 + C).
Branch still at 20 raw / 18 real axioms, 0 sorries.

## 2026-05-31 — UNIT 7 complete: `asymChaosCutoffDecomposition` axiom → theorem

`asymChaosCutoffDecomposition` (`AsymTorus/AsymNelson.lean`, the heterogeneous
Glimm–Jaffe dynamical-cutoff smooth/rough chaos decomposition) is now a
**theorem** (commit `c5d91e7`). pphi2 on `cylinder-isotropic-lattice` drops
to **20 raw / 18 real axioms, 0 sorries**.

Proof (~100 lines): trivial split `V_S(M, ω) := -(M/2)`,
`E_R(M, ω) := interactionFunctionalAsym ω + M/2`. C1 and C2 are then
definitional; C3 uses the joint→config pushforward
`asymCanonicalJointMeasure_map_sumConfig` (`AsymFieldDecomposition.lean:1692`)
plus a new one-line naturality
`interactionFunctionalAsym_asymCanonicalSumConfig_eq` plus UNIT 2's
`asymCanonicalSmoothInteraction_lower_bound_at_cutoff_uniform` (subset
`{full ≤ -M} ⊆ {rough ≤ -M/2}` for `M ≥ 2C`) plus UNIT 6's
`asymCanonicalRoughError_neg_tail_uniform`. Witness `ψ` and integrability
reused verbatim from the square's `degreePiecewiseTail` + `_layerCake_lt_top`
(lattice-agnostic, three `private` defs widened to public).

Only project-introduced axiom remaining on this branch:
`asymInteracting_expMoment_volume_uniform` (`AsymTorus/AsymContinuumLimit.lean`,
the volume-uniform interacting exp-moment — the genuine cluster-expansion input).

## 2026-05-31 — UNIT 6 complete (asym chaos-membership + rough-tail wrapper)

UNIT 6 of the `asymChaosCutoffDecomposition` discharge plan is complete
without changing pphi2's axiom count:

* **UNIT 6a** (commit `32f9484`): 786-line mechanical port of the square's
  chaos-membership stack (`RoughErrorBound.lean:1620–2006` and
  `FieldDecomposition.lean:72–130`) to the asym namespace in a new
  `Pphi2/NelsonEstimate/AsymRoughErrorChaosStd.lean`. All 10 deliverables
  present (`asymCanonicalJointStdGaussianMeasurableEquiv`,
  `asymCanonicalJointMeasure_map_stdGaussian`, `asymCanonicalCrossTermStd`
  + chaos membership, `asymCanonicalRoughErrorStd` + chaos membership).
  Asym gamma stack reused from `AsymCrossTermL2Identity.lean` (UNIT 5).
* **UNIT 6b** (commit `63c0cd2`): the
  `asymCanonicalRoughError_neg_tail_uniform` wrapper (and its
  `_of_stdGaussian_explicit_ae` helper) appended to the same file —
  packages UNIT 5 (variance) + UNIT 6a (chaos membership) into the
  dimension-independent polynomial-chaos negative-tail bound on the
  asym joint measure.

**Impact on pphi2 count:** unchanged at 19 real / 21 raw axioms, 0
sorries. UNIT 7 (axiom-discharge assembly via the joint↔config
pushforward bridge) is the only step left to drop the count to 18 real
/ 20 raw.

## 2026-05-15 — Lp-carrier Phase 2 + gaussian-hilbert Phase 3 wire-in

The 2026-05-13 → 2026-05-15 sister-repo work substantially advanced the
upstream layers without changing pphi2's own axiom count:

* **markov-semigroups Lp-carrier Phase 2** (commit `6782dc7` on
  `feat/lp-carrier-stdGaussianFin-dirichletmarkov`): concrete
  `GaussianFin.stdGaussianFin_dirichletMarkovSemigroup n :
  DirichletMarkovSemigroup (Fin n → ℝ)` bundle + 7 proved
  operator-valued semigroup laws on `Lp ℝ 2 (γFin n)`. Active axiom
  count unchanged at 11. The bundle's `energy_eq_deriv` field uses an
  interim polarization proof that makes the existing
  `ouSemigroupFin_l2_sq_hasDerivWithinAt` axiom load-bearing at the
  public bundle boundary; Phase 2.5 fresh-Fubini cleanup is queued
  (~1.5 days, would drop the count to 10).
* **gaussian-hilbert Phase 3 smoke test** (commit `0f0c5eb` on
  `phase-3-smoke-test`): bumps the markov-semigroups pin to the
  Phase 2 branch and adds two compiling `example` checks confirming
  the bundle reaches the public boundary and slots into
  `gross_lsi_implies_hypercontractive`. gaussian-hilbert's local
  axiom count unchanged at 1, but the closure of
  `stdGaussianFin_dirichletMarkovSemigroup` from this repo now
  visibly carries `ouSemigroupFin_l2_sq_hasDerivWithinAt` until
  Phase 2.5 lands.

**Impact on pphi2:** Workstream C (gaussian-hilbert OU/Mehler
discharge) of the T² OS0–OS2 chain is now ~80% complete with ~1–2
active days of E.1+E.2 adapters remaining. See
[`docs/T2-continuum-limit-status-2026-05-13.md`](docs/T2-continuum-limit-status-2026-05-13.md)
(refreshed 2026-05-15) for the full rollup.

## Purpose

In this project, an **axiom** is a *vetted provable theorem with a
vetted discharge plan* — not a fundamental unprovable assumption. Each
axiom listed below is:

1. A standard textbook fact, with explicit literature citation.
2. Reviewed for type correctness, hypothesis sufficiency, and
   non-vacuity (typically by a Gemini deep-think pass and/or a
   literature cross-check).
3. Accompanied by a concrete plan to discharge it into a Lean theorem
   (inline in the row, or linked to a dedicated discharge-plan doc).

We use the `axiom` keyword as a *staging point* — it lets the project
proceed to use a result before its full Lean proof is assembled, while
keeping the trust boundary explicit and discharge progress trackable.
The goal is for every entry to eventually become a proved theorem.

Format and conventions for this audit doc: `~/.claude/AXIOM_AUDIT_FORMAT.md`.
(This was migrated from `docs/axiom_audit.md` to top-level
`AXIOM_AUDIT.md` per the new convention.)

## Summary

| Package | Axioms | Sorries | Pin |
|---|---|---|---|
| **pphi2** (active build) | 18 | 0 | — |

**New axiom 2026-06-05** (`+1`, active build): `torus_weakCoupling_lattice_connectedFourPoint_strictNeg`
(`TorusContinuumLimit/TorusInteractingResult.lean`) — **weak-coupling, pure-quartic** uniform strict
lattice bound. Signature: `(P : InteractionPolynomial) (hP : P.n = 4)`, then
`∃ m₀>0, ∀ mass>m₀, ∃ f c>0, ∀N, u₄(torusInteractingMeasure L N P mass)(f) ≤ −c`. **The `hP : P.n = 4`
hypothesis** (added 2026-06-06) scopes the axiom to the pure quartic, matching the discharge route:
`u₄'(0)=−6∫(C_a f)⁴` and step 2b (`wickFourth_interaction_inner_quartic`) are quartic-specific
(leading Wick term `6=4!·¼`), so the axiom does not over-claim interaction for every
`InteractionPolynomial`. The one analytic
input behind the headline `torus_pphi2_isInteracting_weakCoupling` (the genuine T² limit is
interacting / non-Gaussian, **at weak coupling**); everything else is proved
(`torusInteractingLimit_exists` + the axiom-clean step-IV moment convergence
`torus_connectedFourPoint_tendsto`). **Restricted to weak coupling** (`mass > m₀` ⟺ dimensionless
`g = 1/(4mass²) < g₀`), where the corrections are controlled — the regime non-triviality only needs.
**Rating: Likely correct** — perturbative weak-coupling non-triviality: leading
`u₄'(0)=−6∫(C_a f)⁴<0` strictly dominates the `O(g²)` remainder (Nelson hypercontractivity at fixed
volume, **no cluster expansion**; uses `GaussianHilbert.polynomial_chaos_concentration` via
`NelsonEstimate`). **Sources: DT** (leading term Gemini-vetted 2026-06-04/05, memory
`pphi2-u4-proof-route`), LP (Simon *P(φ)₂* Ch. V/VIII; Glimm–Jaffe Ch. 8–9, 19). **(NOT VERIFIED)** —
discharge via the perturbative route (`FieldRedefinition.lean` +
`planning/{torus-interacting,lambda-coupling-family}-*.md`). (Strong coupling left out — `u₄<0` still
holds there by Lebowitz, non-perturbatively, but non-triviality doesn't need it.)
**Discharge progress (2026-06-05):** the decisive analytic brick — the smeared Wick/Mehler kernel
`∫ :φ(f)ⁿ::φ(g)ᵐ: dμ_GFF = δₘₙ·n!·⟨φfφg⟩ⁿ` — is now **proved axiom-clean** as
`GaussianField.gff_wickPower_two_smeared_inner` (the `n=m=4` case gives the `4!⟨φfφg⟩⁴` connected
kernel underlying `u₄'(0)=−6∫(C_a f)⁴`). Remaining for the discharge: the first-order coefficient
`u₄'(0)=−⟨:φ(f)⁴:V⟩_free`, the `(C_a f)` operator object, step-II positivity, step-III Nelson
remainder. See memory `smeared-wick-kernel-done`.

**SUPERSEDED by an axiom-free alternative (2026-06-07).** Route A now proves T² non-Gaussianity
**without this axiom**: `torus_pphi2_isInteractingStrict_weakCoupling`
(`TorusContinuumLimit/TorusCouplingResult.lean`, `#print axioms ⟹ [propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound]`) gives `u₄ < 0` at weak coupling via a coupling-family continuum limit + 4-homogeneity,
not the large-mass field redefinition. This axiom is still in the tree (only the *older* headline
`torus_pphi2_isInteracting_weakCoupling` consumes it); it can be **retired** once that older headline
is migrated to the Route-A theorem or removed. See `planning/route-A-weak-coupling-plan.md`.

Notes:

* pphi2 count includes 2 private axioms
  (`gaussian_rp_cov_perfect_square`,
  `asymTorusInteracting_exponentialMomentBound`).
* The pphi2 pin for **GaussianField is stale** relative to current
  upstream `main` (today's upstream is at ~3 axioms thanks to the
  2026-05-10 spatial-translation + master-equivariance discharges).
  Pin bump deferred until PR #16 lands.
* **gaussian-hilbert is at 1 axiom** as of 2026-05-11 thanks to
  back-to-back discharges of `ouSemigroupAct` (spectral shortcut,
  2026-05-10), `ouSemigroupAct_eq_smul_of_mem_wienerChaos` (same), and
  `polynomial_dense_L2_of_subGaussian` (L²-orthogonal-complement /
  Carleman, 2026-05-11). The remaining axiom is
  `ouSemigroupAct_eLpNorm_hypercontractive` (Bonami-Beckner-Nelson) —
  discharge plan at `gaussian-hilbert/docs/hypercontractivity-discharge-plan.md`.
* The markov-semigroups count is 11 (2 core hypercontractivity + 2
  concentration/Poincaré + 4 Gaussian1D BGL + 2 DZ + 1 matrix; the 3
  Gaussian-OU placeholder axioms moved to gaussian-hilbert in the
  2026-05-10 split, and 2 of those have since been discharged
  upstream).

## 2026-05-16 Phase B textbook axioms discharged

The two Phase B textbook axioms in
`Pphi2/NelsonEstimate/CovarianceBoundsGJ.lean` are now theorems:

- `smoothWickConstant_le_log_uniform_in_aN`
- `canonicalRoughCovariance_pow_sum_le_uniform_in_aN`

What landed:
- `HeatKernelBound.lean`: Phase 1b smooth-side discharge.
- `FieldDecomposition.lean`: the heat-kernel/Fubini/semigroup bridge
  lemmas for the rough side.
- `CovarianceBoundsGJ.lean`: Phase 2 (`m = 1`), Phase 3 (`m = 2`), and
  Phase 4 (`m ≥ 3`) completed, including the final Bochner/Minkowski
  argument.

Verification:
- `lake build` succeeds for the full project.
- `#print axioms Pphi2.rough_error_variance` now shows only
  `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

Net effect:
- pphi2 axiom count: `19 → 17`
- pphi2 sorry count: unchanged at `0`
- `rough_error_variance` is now fully theorem-derived from the standard
  logical trio, with no local Phase B analytical axioms remaining.

The remaining T² interacting critical-path axiom in pphi2 is now only
`polynomial_chaos_exp_moment_bridge`.

## 2026-05-12 (later) S4 + S5 discharged using Phase B axioms

Following the Phase B textbook-axiom proposal + Gemini DT vetting (entry
below), the two proposed axioms were introduced into
`Pphi2/NelsonEstimate/CovarianceBoundsGJ.lean` and used to prove S4
and S5. **First time the rough_error_variance critical-path file has
zero sorries.**

What landed (Codex):
- `Pphi2/NelsonEstimate/CovarianceBoundsGJ.lean` (new file, 33 lines):
  the two Phase B textbook axioms with the corrected `hd : d = 2` +
  post-∃ T-quantifier signatures.
- `canonicalCrossTerm_l2_sq_le` (S4, RoughErrorBound.lean:1275): proved
  by diagonal 2-site Wick formula + Hölder-style covariance bounding +
  the two new axioms.
- `rough_error_variance` (S5, RoughErrorBound.lean:1517): proved by
  S3 (canonicalRoughError_l2_sq_eq) + S4 + integrability discharges +
  finite-sum arithmetic.
- Generic integrability helpers: `integrable_sum_mul_sum_of_pairwise`
  (line 274), `integrable_sq_real_sum_of_pairwise` (line 299).

Verification: `#print axioms` confirms exactly
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound,
 smoothWickConstant_le_log_uniform_in_aN,
 canonicalRoughCovariance_pow_sum_le_uniform_in_aN]` for both S4 and S5.

Pphi2 sorry count: 2 → 0.
Pphi2 axiom count: 17 → 19.

**Status of the polynomial_chaos_exp_moment_bridge critical-path
axiom:** Step 1 (`rough_error_variance`) is now complete. Remaining
phases 2 + 3 (apply Janson 5.10 for L^p + tail bounds; layer-cake
assembly into `LatticeRoughErrorSetup`) are described in
`docs/polynomial-chaos-exp-moment-bridge-proof-plan.md`. Neither adds
new pphi2 axioms beyond the two Phase B textbook axioms here.

## 2026-05-12 Phase B textbook axiom proposal + Gemini DT vetting

After yesterday's S3 discharge (`canonicalCrossTerm_inner_eq_zero`
axiom-free) and the upstream variance identification, the only
remaining analytical content on `rough_error_variance` is the
Glimm-Jaffe Ch. 8 Fourier estimates needed for S4. Two textbook
axioms suffice to close S4 + S5 (the two remaining pphi2 sorries):

1. **`smoothWickConstant_le_log_uniform_in_aN`** — Glimm-Jaffe Thm 8.5.2
   (smooth-side, d=2). `smoothWickConstant T ≤ A + B·(1 + |log T|)`
   uniform in (N, a) at fixed L = N·a.

2. **`canonicalRoughCovariance_pow_sum_le_uniform_in_aN`** —
   Glimm-Jaffe Thm 8.5.2 (rough-side, d=2). `a^d · Σ_y |C_R(x,y)|^m
   ≤ C_m · T` for all m ≥ 1, uniform in (N, a) at fixed L.

Plan: [`docs/phase-B-textbook-axioms.md`](docs/phase-B-textbook-axioms.md).
Discharge plan inline (per `AXIOM_MANAGEMENT.md` requirement):

- **Axiom 1 discharge (~500–800 lines, ~2–3 weeks):** tighten the
  existing `heat_kernel_1d_bound` (currently with the trivial `C = N`
  constant) to the textbook (a, N)-uniform `C(L)` form via the
  existing `gaussian_sum_bound` (`HeatKernelBound.lean:204` already
  proves `Σ exp(-α k²) ≤ √(π/α) + 1` with uniform constant via the
  `sin² ≥ (2/π)² · x²` bound on [0, π/2]). Propagate through
  `heat_kernel_trace_bound`, `smoothVariance_from_heat_kernel`,
  `smoothVariance_le_log_uniform`. Reference: Glimm-Jaffe Thm 8.5.2 +
  Lemma 8.5.4 (lattice heat kernel trace); Reed-Simon vol. II Thm
  XI.2 (heat kernel trace).

- **Axiom 2 discharge (~300–500 lines, ~1–2 weeks):** m=1 case from
  the Schwinger identity + heat-kernel probability normalisation
  (`a^d · Σ_y p_t(x, y) = 1`, hence `a^d · Σ_y C_R(x, y) = ∫_0^T 1 dt
  = T`); m=2 from a position-space rewrite of the existing
  `roughCovariance_sq_summable` via Plancherel + translation
  invariance; m ≥ 3 from Hölder interpolation between m=2 and the
  off-diagonal L^∞ bound on C_R (which decays Gaussian-exponentially
  in |x − y|, dominating the at-most-logarithmic coincident-points
  divergence in d=2). Reference: Glimm-Jaffe Thm 8.5.2 + Lemma 8.5.5
  (rough covariance position-space estimates); Janson, *Gaussian
  Hilbert Spaces*, Ch. 6.

**Gemini deep-think vetting (2026-05-12)** of both axioms — verdict
Standard / DT — caught two bugs in the initial draft, fixes landed
at commit `73eb939`:

(i) **d = 2 trap.** Both axioms are mathematically false for d ≥ 3
(smooth diverges as T^{-1/2}, rough L^m scales as `T^{m(1-d/2) + d/2}`
which diverges for m ≥ 3 at d = 3). The linear-in-T scaling is a
magical d=2 property: `m(1-1) + 1 = 1` exactly when d = 2. Corrected
statements carry `hd : d = 2`.

(ii) **S4/S5 quantifier trap.** Both existing sorry signatures had
`T` bound *before* `∃ K`, allowing Skolemization `K = K(T)` that
would nullify the O(T · polylog) scaling. Corrected by moving `T`
inside the `∀ N a` block, after `∃ K`, so K is forced to be a
function only of `(k, j, mass, L)` (S4) or `(P, mass, L)` (S5).

**Status: NOT yet introduced into the codebase.** When introduced,
pphi2 sorry count drops 2 → 0 (S4 + S5 close); axiom count goes
17 → 19. Combined Phase B discharge effort ~3-5 weeks at recalibrated
project norms. The axioms are at the right granularity to be lifted
into upstream gaussian-field once discharged (they're about lattice
Fourier estimates, not pphi2-specific).

## 2026-05-11 audit pass (gaussian-hilbert polynomial-density discharge)

Upstream gaussian-hilbert discharged `polynomial_dense_L2_of_subGaussian`
via the L²-orthogonal-complement / Carleman moment-determinacy route
(commit
[`265b30e`](https://github.com/mrdouglasny/gaussian-hilbert/commit/265b30e)).

Verified via `#print axioms` against gaussian-hilbert main: the entire
chaos-pipeline up to and including `chaosCoordEquiv`, `ouSemigroupAct`,
and `ouSemigroupAct_eq_smul_of_mem_wienerChaos` now depends on only
the standard logical axioms (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`).
The single remaining gaussian-hilbert axiom
(`ouSemigroupAct_eLpNorm_hypercontractive`) is intentionally deferred —
it requires the Mehler integral + LSI tensorization / Bakry-Émery
(documented in `gaussian-hilbert/docs/hypercontractivity-discharge-plan.md`).

**Downstream impact on pphi2**: the polynomial-chaos concentration
chain (`bonami_nelson_chaos`, `polynomial_chaos_concentration`) now
depends transitively on **one** upstream axiom — the deferred
hypercontractivity placeholder. Once pphi2's gaussian-hilbert pin is
bumped to current `main`, pphi2's Cluster A axioms (the four Nelson
exponential estimates) become "one upstream axiom away" from native
discharge.

## 2026-05-10 plan revision: `rough_error_variance` Step 1 rev 2 (Gemini DT)

The Step 1 sub-plan for discharging
`polynomial_chaos_exp_moment_bridge` was revised in `rough-error-variance-plan.md`
(renamed from `rough-error-variance-codex-plan.md`; the older
`rough-error-variance-design.md` from 2026-05-09 is now superseded but
preserved). Changes vs rev 1:

- **Quantifier hygiene** (was bug). `K` is now bound *outside*
  `(N, a)` with constraint `(N : ℝ) * a = L` so it can't depend on
  the lattice parameters and break continuum-limit uniformity.
- **m=1 cross-term proof** (was bug). Cauchy–Schwarz gave
  `O(T^{1/2})` for variance — wrong direction, would break Trotter
  convergence. Replaced by L¹ heat-kernel bound on `C_R` × L^∞ bound
  on `C_S^j`.
- **m≥2 cross-term proof** (was bug). `‖C_R‖_∞` factor blows up as
  `a → 0` because `C_R(x,x) ∼ log(1/a)` carries the 2D UV divergence.
  Replaced by `(a, N)`-uniform L^m sum bound on `C_R`. m=1 and m≥2
  are now treated uniformly.
- **RHS form** (was bug). `≤ K · T` is provably false because
  `‖C_S‖_∞ ∼ 1 + |log T|` injects a polylog. RHS is now
  `K · T · (1 + |log T|)^{P.n − 1}`, where the exponent `P.n − 1` is
  the maximum power of the smooth factor (since `m ≥ 1` forces
  `j ≤ P.n − 1` in the binomial expansion).
- **Three upstream sorries named**:
  `canonicalSmoothCovariance_le_log` (Glimm-Jaffe Thm 8.5.2,
  `(a, N)`-uniform smooth covariance bound),
  `canonicalRoughCovariance_pow_sum_le` (Glimm-Jaffe Thm 8.5.2,
  `(a, N)`-uniform L^m sum on rough covariance, all `m ≥ 1`),
  `joint_wick_factorization` (Mathlib measure-theory product
  factorization for the joint Gaussian). These quarantine the hard
  harmonic analysis behind named API; the algebraic Wick reduction
  S1–S5 can be implemented now.

Source of revision: codex flagged the original 2026-05-09 design doc
as needing scope corrections; Gemini chat (gemini-3-pro-preview)
caught four issues in the codex correction; Gemini deep-think (via
manual paste — automated MCP run was stuck) confirmed all four and
added the measure-theory factorization concern. Verbatim review at
`rough-error-variance-deep-think-review.md`.

The rev-2 plan also confirms `rough_error_variance` as a real Step 1
deliverable for the bridge axiom (not just scaffolding): Janson 5.10
(`polynomial_chaos_concentration` in gaussian-hilbert) takes the L²
bound as input and produces the L^p / stretched-exponential tail
needed by `LatticeRoughErrorSetup` (`LatticeBridge.lean:63`).

## 2026-05-10 audit pass (gaussian-hilbert split)

Architectural refactoring: the four chaos files
(HermitePolynomials, WienerChaos, OUEigenfunctions, PolynomialChaosConcentration)
plus the polynomial-density axiom file moved out of markov-semigroups
+ gaussian-field into a new repo
[gaussian-hilbert](https://github.com/mrdouglasny/gaussian-hilbert)
under the namespace `GaussianHilbert.*`. Reasons:
- Thematic: the cluster is "facts about Gaussian Hilbert space"
  (Janson 1997), neither pure abstract semigroup theory nor pure
  Gaussian-measure infrastructure.
- Architectural: the cluster needs both gaussian-field (Wick algebra,
  polynomial L²-density) and markov-semigroups (Bakry-Émery + Gross's
  hypercontractivity duality, for the future OU/Mehler discharge).
  Putting it in either upstream repo would create or perpetuate a
  cross-repo dependency. As a separate downstream repo, both
  upstreams stay independent, and only consumers that need the chaos
  material (currently pphi2 + future Stein-Malliavin work) pay the
  cost of importing both.

pphi2 consumer changes:
- New require in `lakefile.toml`: `gaussian-hilbert` pinned to `main`.
- `Pphi2/NelsonEstimate/ChaosTailBridge.lean`: `import` and `open`
  rewired (`MarkovSemigroups.Gaussian.PolynomialChaosConcentration` →
  `GaussianHilbert.PolynomialChaosConcentration`,
  `open MarkovSemigroups.Gaussian` → `open GaussianHilbert`).
- `Pphi2/NelsonEstimate/PolynomialChaosBridge.lean`: docstring
  references rewired similarly.

Net effect on pphi2's `polynomial_chaos_concentration` consumer (verified
via `#print axioms`): no change in axiom set, only namespace rewrite.
Still depends on the 3 OU placeholder axioms (now `GaussianHilbert.*`
rather than `MarkovSemigroups.Gaussian.*`).

Pin bumps:
- `MarkovSemigroups`: `1bfe386` → `3cb482d` (deleted Gaussian/* + dropped GaussianField require)
- `GaussianField`: `24b26ef` → `9c66a40` (deleted `GeneralResults/PolynomialDensityGaussian.lean`)
- `gaussian-hilbert`: new dep at `05ee231` (initial publication, holds the migrated cluster + its plan docs)

## 2026-05-09 audit pass (markov-semigroups discharge + pin bump)

This session discharged two markov-semigroups axioms in the Wiener-chaos
cluster:

| Axiom | What changed | Sources |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| `MarkovSemigroups.Gaussian.hermiteMulti_dense` | **axiom → theorem.** Proved via `MvPolynomial.induction_on` + Hermite three-term recurrence + `Submodule.span` change-of-basis between multivariate monomials and multivariate Hermite polynomials. The proof rests on a single new external axiom in gaussian-field, `GaussianField.GeneralResults.polynomial_dense_L2_of_subGaussian` (Janson Thm 2.6 — see gaussian-field section below). | DT (Janson Thm 2.6), this session |
| `MarkovSemigroups.Gaussian.wienerChaos_isInternalDirectSum` | **broken statement → replaced and proved.** The legacy axiom (`DirectSum.IsInternal`) was strictly stronger than the true theorem (would have required every L² function to admit a finite chaos expansion, while generic L² functions need infinite L²-convergent expansions). Replaced with the correct Hilbert-sum statement `wienerChaos_isHilbertSum : IsHilbertSum ℝ (wienerChaos n) ...` and proved from `hermiteMulti_dense` via `IsHilbertSum.mkInternal`. | DT (correct statement is the Hilbert direct sum, not the algebraic direct sum), this session |

Net effect on transitive axiom dependencies of pphi2's
`polynomial_chaos_concentration` consumer (`#print axioms` verified):
the 3 OU placeholder axioms in `MarkovSemigroups.Gaussian.OUEigenfunctions`
(`ouSemigroupAct`, `ouSemigroupAct_eq_smul_of_mem_wienerChaos`,
`ouSemigroupAct_eLpNorm_hypercontractive`) are unchanged. The
`hermiteMulti_dense` discharge does *not* propagate up to
`polynomial_chaos_concentration` because that theorem doesn't transitively
use it.

Pin bumps:
- `MarkovSemigroups`: `cdb2538a` → `1bfe386` (this session's discharges + 2 doc additions: `docs/AXIOM_AUDIT.md`, `docs/ou-mehler-discharge-plan.md`)
- `GaussianField`: `2dce94f` → `24b26ef` (added `GeneralResults/PolynomialDensityGaussian.lean`; an attempted move of the Wiener-chaos cluster from markov-semigroups to gaussian-field was reverted after architectural review — see commit history)

## 2026-05-08 audit pass (Cluster A pre-discharge axiom corrections)

Four axiom-statement bugs were caught and corrected before any proof
work on the polynomial-chaos concentration / Nelson estimate /
GFF orthogonal-bridge architecture. All four corrections were vetted
by `deep_think_gemini` (DT, 2026-05-08).

| Axiom | File:Line | Old issue | New status | Sources |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| `GaussianField.gffOrthonormalCoord` (def) | StandardGaussianBridge.lean:82 | Wrong divisor `√λ_k` (gives variance `(a^d)⁻¹`, not 1) | Fixed: divisor now `√(a^d λ_k)` so `Var(ξ_k) = 1` | DT, GJ-aligned spectral identity |
| `GaussianField.siteWickMonomial_eigenbasis_expansion` | WickMultivariate.lean:198 | Free `c : ℝ` parameter — false for `c ≠ c_a(x)` | Fixed: c specialised to `gffSiteVariance d N a mass ha hmass x = (a^d)⁻¹ Σ_k λ_k⁻¹ e_k(x)²` | DT (Hermite-projection chaos identity) |

**Sources legend** (per project convention): `DT` = Gemini
deep-think vet, `LP` = literature proof with page number, `SA` =
self-audit, `PR` = peer review.

The first three corrections are required *before* attempting any
discharge of the bridge axioms — the buggy versions would have led to
unprovable downstream chains.

The 4-axiom delta over `main` (which has 15 in pphi2) is the surviving
Stage 1 GJ-aligned **Cluster A** (Nelson dynamical-cutoff family). Stage 1
raised pphi2 22 → 29 when the lattice action was renormalised to
`S = (a^d/2)⟨φ, M_a φ⟩` with `gaussianDensity = exp(-(a^d/2)⟨φ, Qφ⟩)`.
Phase 2 partial discharge brought the count back down by 9 in pphi2
(and 2 in gaussian-field). Cluster B is complete.

**2026-05-08**: `normalizedGaussianDensityMeasure_linearFourier`,
`torus_propagator_convergence_GJ`, `roughCovariance_sq_summable`,
`smoothVariance_le_log` (trivial-`C` form), and
`normalizedGaussianDensityMeasure_eq_normalizedQuadraticGaussianMeasure`
all converted axiom → theorem. PR #14 (merged main) additionally
discharged `fourierTransform_lp_eq_fourierIntegral` and refactored
`cylinderIR_uniform_exponential_moment` / `cylinderIR_os3` away from
axiom form.

**2026-04-25**: `cylinderIR_uniform_second_moment` converted from axiom to
**theorem** by deriving it from `cylinderIR_uniform_exponential_moment` via the
elementary inequality `x² ≤ 2 e^|x|` and a scaling optimization.

## Verification Sources

- **GR** = `docs/gemini_review.md` (2026-02-23) — external review in 5 thematic groups
- **DT** = Gemini deep think verification (date noted)
- **SA** = self-audit (this document)
- **(NOT VERIFIED)** = no external review beyond self-audit

## Self-Audit Ratings

- **✅ Standard** — well-known mathematical fact, stated correctly
- **⚠️ Likely correct** — mathematically sound, needs careful type/quantifier verification
- **❓ Needs review** — potentially problematic or non-standard formulation
- **🔧 Placeholder** — conclusion is `True` or trivially weak

---

**2026-05-07**: `cylinderIR_os3` removed as an axiom. Route B′ now assumes the
eventual pullback RP predicate `CylinderMeasureSequenceEventuallyReflectionPositive`
and proves the IR-limit OS3 transfer by characteristic-functional convergence.

### Historical note: isotropic `Z_Nt × Z_Ns` cylinder redesign

The heterogeneous-lattice cylinder construction. Both are deep-think-vetted analytic inputs.
`asymChaosCutoffDecomposition` has a clear discharge path (port the proved square Nelson machinery);
`asymInteracting_expMoment_volume_uniform` is the genuine deep input (volume-uniform interacting
exp-moment ≡ cylinder transfer-matrix gap / cluster expansion).

**Discharged 2026-05-27:** `wickConstantAsym_eq_variance` (was the third axiom) is now a **theorem**
(`AsymTorus/AsymWickVariance.lean` + `AsymWickMean.lean`), proved by the algebraic circulant route
(`massOperatorAsym` commutes with lattice translations ⟹ spectral covariance is shift-invariant ⟹
the diagonal is constant = the eigenvalue average; `#print axioms` clean).

Heterogeneous-lattice analogue of the square Nelson dynamical-cutoff input, for the
metric-correct `Z_Nt × Z_Ns` cylinder construction (Phase-2 #3, B-lean).

| File | Active axioms | Names |
|------|---------------|-------|
| `Pphi2/AsymTorus/AsymContinuumLimit.lean` | 1 | `asymInteracting_expMoment_volume_uniform` |

(`wickConstantAsym_eq_variance` was here; **discharged → theorem** 2026-05-27, see below.
`asymChaosCutoffDecomposition` was here; **discharged → theorem** 2026-05-31 via the
trivial-split + pushforward + UNIT 2 + UNIT 6 route described at the top of this audit.)

| Axiom | File:Line | Rating | Sources | Notes |
|-------|-----------|--------|---------|-------|
| `asymChaosCutoffDecomposition` | `AsymTorus/AsymNelson.lean:62` | Likely correct | DT | Existence of the Glimm–Jaffe dynamical-cutoff smooth/rough chaos decomposition on `Z_Nt × Z_Ns` with a `ψ` tail uniform in `(Nt,Ns,a)` at fixed volume `Lt·Ls`. Heterogeneous analogue of the **proved** square decomposition (`canonicalSmoothInteraction`/`canonicalRoughError` + the two `…_uniform` theorems); feeds the proved generic engine `bridgeAxiom_of_setup_real_generic` to give the theorem `asymNelson_exponential_estimate_iso`. Ref: Glimm–Jaffe Ch. 8; Simon *P(φ)₂* Thm V.12/V.15. deep-think-gemini (2026-05-27): **Standard / Likely correct** — uniformity at fixed volume confirmed (Simon V.12/V.15), UV singularity isotropic ⇒ rectangle adds no obstruction, mass gap controls IR. **Discharge plan**: port `FieldDecomposition`/`RoughErrorBound`/`CovarianceBoundsGJ` to `Z_Nt × Z_Ns` using the Phase-1b heterogeneous DFT (`gaussian-field AsymCovariance`). **Port progress 2026-05-27** — `AsymFieldDecomposition.lean` (★ `pushforward_eq_GFF`, `ab6dcdb`) + `AsymCovarianceBoundsGJ.lean` UNITs 1 (interaction defs) + 4 (factorized heat-kernel trace bounds incl. the smooth-Wick log gate `asymSmoothWickConstant_le_log_uniform`, `48b479e`) + 3·{pow_one,pow_two} (rough-cov L¹/L² row sums, `014c598`) all done; every top theorem has `#axioms = [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. Continued 2026-05-28: UNIT 3 `of_three_le` (`b50014e`, `AsymRoughCovarianceHigherP.lean`) + UNIT 2 (smooth lower bound `V_S ≥ −M/2`, `1495eb6`, `AsymSmoothLowerBound.lean`) + UNIT 5 `asymRoughError_variance` (`e33cef7`/discharge in `AsymCrossTermL2Identity.lean` with the cross-term L² identity ported in full — gamma defs, smooth/rough site-variance identities mirroring the proved `wickConstantAsym_eq_variance` chain, the 6 two-site marginal Wick lemmas plugged through the now-public index-polymorphic `wickPower_two_site_pi_gaussianReal_*` helpers, and the L² covSum identity). All top theorems including `asymCanonicalCrossTerm_l2_sq_le` and `asymRoughError_variance` `#axioms = [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. Remaining: UNIT 6 (rough chaos tail via `ChaosTailBridge` — engine is generic) → UNIT 7 (bridge assembly via `bridgeAxiom_of_setup_real_generic` — discharges the axiom). |
| `wickConstantAsym_eq_variance` | `AsymTorus/AsymWickMean.lean:63` | **DISCHARGED → theorem (2026-05-27)** | proved | Now a theorem (`AsymWickVariance.lean`, algebraic circulant route: `massOperatorAsym_translation_commute` + `spectralCovAsym_massOperator_eq` + shift isometry ⟹ `covariance_spectralLatticeCovarianceAsym_translation_invariant` ⟹ diagonal constant = eigenvalue average via `massEigenvectorBasisAsym` orthonormality; `#print axioms` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`). Original content: the site variance `⟪T_GJ δ_x, T_GJ δ_x⟫` of the heterogeneous GFF equals `wickConstantAsym` at **every** site `x`. The spatial **average** already equals `wickConstantAsym` by eigenbasis orthonormality (`Σ_x e_k(x)² = 1`); the only content is site-**independence**, i.e. translation invariance of the diagonal of `(−Δ_a + m²)^{-1}`, which is circulant on the finite abelian group `Z_Nt × Z_Ns`. Heterogeneous analogue of the **proved** square `wickConstant_eq_variance`. Feeds the Wick mean-zero chain (`wickMonomialAsym_latticeGaussian` → `interactionFunctionalAsym_mean_nonpos` → `partitionFunctionAsym_ge_one`) and hence `density_transfer_bound_iso` and the iso cutoff exp-moment bound. deep-think-gemini (2026-05-27): **Standard / Likely correct** — circulant-matrix diagonal independence is unconditionally true; the `(a²)⁻¹` GJ normalization matches the `d = 2` lattice action; statement is exactly what Wick ordering requires (marginal `ω(δ_x) ∼ N(0, wickConstantAsym)`). **Discharge plan**: port the square translation-invariance (Lebesgue density representation + volume-preserving shift on `Z_Nt × Z_Ns → ℝ`), OR derive site-independence algebraically from the DFT shift identities (`cos_shift_sum`/`sin_shift_sum`). |
| `asymInteracting_expMoment_volume_uniform` | `AsymTorus/AsymContinuumLimit.lean` | Likely correct | DT | **The genuine deep input.** `∃ K C > 0`, uniform in the time period `L` and lattice `(Nt,Ns,a)` (fixed `Ls`): `∫ exp\|ωf\| dμ_int ≤ K·exp(C·σ²(f))`. The volume-uniform interacting exp-moment of P(φ)₂ — the input the metric-mismatched square construction never supplied. Discharges the `hUnif` hypothesis of `routeBPrimeIso_cylinder_OS`, giving `cylinderIso_OS_of_RP_OS2`. deep-think-gemini (2026-05-27): **Standard / Likely correct with the `C·σ²` exponent** — the original `C = 1` form is **false** in infinite volume (interacting susceptibility can exceed `2/m²`; Cauchy–Schwarz prefactor `½p(2λ)−p(λ) > 0` by strict convexity, so `Z⁻¹·K_Nelson^{½}` cannot be volume-uniform). With `∃ C`: TRUE via Newman/Lee–Yang Gaussian-domination of the MGF (`K = 2`) + interacting-variance domination by the free one through the strict mass gap (`C = C₀/2`); uniform in `a` (lattice RP/ferromagnetic) and in `L` (fixed `Ls` ⟹ quasi-1D ⟹ Perron–Frobenius mass gap, bounded susceptibility). Ref: Glimm–Jaffe Ch.18–19; Simon Ch. V/VIII; Newman (1975); Glimm–Jaffe–Spencer. See `docs/cylinder-conditional-inputs-provability.md` §4. **Discharge plan (cylinder shortcut)**: fixed `Ls`, `L→∞` is a 1D thermodynamic limit (no phase transition); the transfer matrix `e^{-aH_{Ls}}` has an isolated non-degenerate top eigenvalue (Perron–Frobenius) ⟹ unconditional cylinder mass gap ⟹ chessboard (Fröhlich–Simon–Spencer) + transfer-matrix spectral radius gives the bound — **bypasses the full spatial cluster expansion** (external review, 2026-05-27). |

| 24 | `rotation_cf_defect_polylog_bound` | OS2_WardIdentity | ⚠️ Likely correct | SA 2026-04-19 | Remaining Ward input: direct polynomial-log `a²` bound for the one-point characteristic-functional defect `rotationCFDefect`, stated uniformly in the lattice size `N`. Replaces the stronger pointwise-defect formulation. |
| 25 | ~~`rotation_invariance_continuum`~~ | OS2_WardIdentity | ✅ **PROVED** | SA 2026-04-19 | `Z[R·f] = Z[f]` for `R ∈ O(2)`. Uses the coupled canonical UV/IR bridge + the uniform defect bound + logarithmic asymptotics. |
| 26 | `canonical_continuumMeasure_cf_tendsto` | AxiomInheritance | ⚠️ Design bridge | SA 2026-04-19 | Coupled UV/IR bridge: canonical `continuumMeasure 2 (N n) P (a n) mass` converges CF-wise to `μ` along `a_n → 0`, `N_n → ∞`, and physical volume `(N_n : ℝ) * a_n → ∞`. |
| 27 | `continuum_exponential_moment_bound` | AxiomInheritance | ⚠️ Design bridge | SA 2026-04-19 | Project-level mixed `L¹`/Green bridge `∫ exp(|ω f|) dμ ≤ exp(c₁∫|f| + c₂ G(f,f))`. This fixes the false pure-quadratic claim while matching the downstream OS0/OS1 wrappers. |
| 28 | ~~`analyticOn_generatingFunctionalC`~~ | CharacteristicFunctional | ✅ **PROVED** | DT 2026-02-25 | Exp moments → joint analyticity (Hartogs + dominated convergence). |
| 29 | ~~`continuum_exponential_moments`~~ | AxiomInheritance | **Proved** | SA 2026-04-12 | Derived by scaling from `continuum_exponential_moment_bound`. |

| 31 | `continuum_exponential_clustering` | AxiomInheritance | ⚠️ Correct for P(Φ)₂ | Gemini 2026-03-07 | `‖Z[f + τ_a g] - Z[f]Z[g]‖ ≤ C·exp(-m₀‖a‖)`. Spectral-gap input for continuum OS4. |
| ~~32~~ | ~~`complex_gf_invariant_of_real_gf_invariant`~~ | CharacteristicFunctional | **Proved** | | Identity theorem for analytic functions: F(z)=G(z) on ℝ → F=G on ℂ, evaluate at `z = i`. |
| ~~33~~ | ~~`pphi2_measure_neg_invariant`~~ | CharacteristicFunctional | **Proved** | 2026-02-25 | Z₂ symmetry: map Neg.neg μ = μ. From even P + GFF symmetry + weak limit closure. |
| ~~34~~ | ~~`generatingFunctional_translate_continuous`~~ | CharacteristicFunctional | **Proved** | 2026-02-25 | `t ↦ Z[f + τ_{(t,0)} g]` continuous. Proved via DCT + `continuous_timeTranslationSchwartz`. |

**Proved theorems in the current OS2 / continuum-limit chain:**
- `os4_clustering_implies_ergodicity` (`CharacteristicFunctional`): clustering → ergodicity via Cesàro + reality (**fully proved**)
- `anomaly_vanishes` (`OS2_WardIdentity`): one-point characteristic-functional anomaly satisfies `‖Z_a[R·f] - Z_a[f]‖ ≤ C·a²·(1 + |log a|)^p`
- `os3_for_continuum_limit` (`OS2_WardIdentity`): trig identity decomposition + inline approximant RP (**fully proved**)

- `os1_for_continuum_limit` (`AxiomInheritance`): mixed `L¹`/Green bound → OS1_Regularity (**fully proved**)
- `os2_for_continuum_limit` (`OS2_WardIdentity`): translation + rotation → OS2_EuclideanInvariance
- `os4_for_continuum_limit` (`AxiomInheritance`): exponential clustering → OS4_Clustering (**fully proved**)

### Phase 6: Bridge

| # | Name | File:Line | Rating | Verified | Notes |
|---|------|----------|--------|----------|---------|
| 33 | ~~`IsPphi2ContinuumLimit.toIsPphi2Limit`~~ | Bridge | ✅ **PROVED** | SA 2026-02-25 | Converted from axiom to `theorem`. Proof is `exact h` since `IsPphi2Limit` and `IsPphi2ContinuumLimit` have identical bodies (modulo type aliases). |
| 34 | ~~`measure_determined_by_schwinger`~~ | Bridge | ✅ **PROVED** | 2026-06-02 | Discharged to a theorem via `MeasureUniqueness.measure_eq_of_moments` (finite exp-moments ⇒ entire MGF ⇒ equal moments force equal laws; Cramér–Wold). No new axioms/sorries. |
| 35 | `wick_constant_comparison` | Bridge | ✅ Standard | DT 2026-02-24 | Wick constant ≈ (2π)⁻¹ log(1/a) with bounded remainder. |
| 36 | `schwinger_agreement` | Bridge | ⚠️ Likely correct | DT 2026-02-24 | n-point Schwinger function equality at weak coupling. |
| 37 | `same_continuum_measure` | Bridge | ⚠️ Likely correct | DT 2026-02-24 | Fixed: requires `IsPphi2ContinuumLimit`, `IsPhi4ContinuumLimit`, `IsWeakCoupling`. |
| 38 | `os2_from_phi4` | Bridge | ⚠️ Likely correct | DT 2026-02-24 | Fixed: requires `IsPhi4ContinuumLimit`. |
| 39 | ~~`os3_from_pphi2`~~ | Bridge | ✅ **PROVED** | SA 2026-02-27 | Replaced axiom with theorem: `exact os3_for_continuum_limit ... (IsPphi2ContinuumLimit.toIsPphi2Limit h)`. |

### Route B': Asymmetric Torus (0 axioms — all proved 2026-03-18)

### Notes from DT review (2026-02-25)

**Batch review of 19 new axioms (sorry→axiom conversion):**
- 15 Correct, 2 Likely correct, 1 Suspicious, 0 Wrong
- **Fixed SUSPICIOUS**: `anomaly_bound_from_superrenormalizability` — missing log factors per Glimm-Jaffe Thm 19.3.1. Now `C·a²·(1+|log a|)^p` instead of `C·a²`.
- **Likely correct**: `lattice_rp_matrix` (cos vs exp(i) — correct, both equivalent formulations), `exponential_moment_schwartz_bound` (non-standard norm but correct bound). The remaining Ward axiom is now the direct `N`-uniform defect-level input `rotation_cf_defect_polylog_bound`; the pointwise defect API survives only as proved support lemmas and is no longer axiomatized.
- **Fixed 6 overly-strong axioms**: `translation_invariance_continuum`, `rotation_invariance_continuum`, `continuum_exponential_moments`, `os0_inheritance`, `os3_inheritance`, `os4_inheritance` — all now require `IsPphi2Limit μ P mass`
- **Added 3 new axioms**: `IsPphi2Limit` (marker predicate, later converted to def), `pphi2_limit_exists` (Prokhorov existence, moved to Convergence.lean), `IsPphi2ContinuumLimit.toIsPphi2Limit` (bridge, later proved as theorem)

**Recent change (2026-05-10):** `GeneralResults/PolynomialDensityGaussian.lean`
moved to gaussian-hilbert (commit `9c66a40`). This file held the single
axiom `polynomial_dense_L2_of_subGaussian` (Janson Thm 2.6), which was
introduced for use by markov-semigroups' `hermiteMulti_dense` (now also
in gaussian-hilbert) and never had any internal gaussian-field consumer.
**(2026-05-09)** the previous single axiom
`cylinderMassOperator_equivariant_of_heat_comm` (Cylinder/GreenFunction.lean)
was **mathematically false** — Gemini 3.1-pro-preview produced an explicit
counterexample. Replaced with the `CylinderSpacetimeSymmetry` structure
+ 3 instance axioms supplying the norm-preservation hypothesis.

### Recently discharged in upstream (between 2026-05-10 and 2026-05-11)

| Former axiom | File:Line | Discharged | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `polynomial_dense_L2_of_subGaussian` | `GaussianHilbert/PolynomialDensity.lean:605` | 2026-05-11 ([commit `265b30e`](https://github.com/mrdouglasny/gaussian-hilbert/commit/265b30e)) | L²-orthogonal-complement / Carleman moment-determinacy route. ~590 lines. |
| `ouSemigroupAct` | `GaussianHilbert/OUEigenfunctions.lean:657` | 2026-05-10 ([commit `e6235e9`](https://github.com/mrdouglasny/gaussian-hilbert/commit/e6235e9)) | Spectral shortcut: defined as the diagonal `f_k ↦ e^{-kt} f_k` on the Wiener-chaos Hilbert sum. |
| `ouSemigroupAct_eq_smul_of_mem_wienerChaos` | `GaussianHilbert/OUEigenfunctions.lean:680` | 2026-05-10 (same commit) | Chaos-eigenvalue identity, proved from the spectral construction. |

**Transitive dep summary:** pphi2's `polynomial_chaos_concentration`
consumer (`Pphi2.NelsonEstimate.{ChaosTailBridge, PolynomialChaosBridge}`)
now sees a **single** upstream axiom in gaussian-hilbert
(`ouSemigroupAct_eLpNorm_hypercontractive`), down from 3 in the
2026-05-10 audit. The polynomial-density discharge and OU spectral
discharge propagate to all of `hermiteMulti_dense`,
`wienerChaos_isHilbertSum`, `chaosCoordEquiv`, `ouSemigroupAct`, and
`ouSemigroupAct_eq_smul_of_mem_wienerChaos` (all now Lean-built-ins-only
upstream).

**Pin status note**: pphi2's `gaussian-hilbert` requirement is on
`rev = "main"`, so a `lake update gaussian-hilbert` would pick up the
current state automatically. Deferred until pphi2 PR #16 lands to
avoid disturbing the active review.

## Critical Issues

### 1. ~~❓ `same_continuum_measure`~~ — FIXED (2026-02-24)

**Status**: RESOLVED. Now requires `IsPphi2ContinuumLimit`, `IsPhi4ContinuumLimit`, and `IsWeakCoupling` hypotheses. Also fixed `os2_from_phi4` (was FALSE without `IsPhi4ContinuumLimit`), `os3_from_pphi2` (was FALSE without `IsPphi2ContinuumLimit`), and `measure_determined_by_schwinger` (polynomial→exponential moments).

### 2. ~~❓ `moment_equicontinuity`~~ — FIXED (2026-02-24)

**Status**: RESOLVED. RHS now `C * (SchwartzMap.seminorm ℝ k n (f - g)) ^ 2` with existentially quantified seminorm indices `k n`. Was bare constant `C` (flagged WRONG by GR).

### 3. ⚠️ Current Ward / inheritance surface needs targeted re-review

**Severity**: LOW
**Issue**: the current branch replaced the old direct OS2 / OS0 inputs by the
direct defect-level Ward axiom `rotation_cf_defect_polylog_bound`
and the new root analytic bridge `continuum_exponential_moment_bound`.
These are plausible and match the intended constructive-QFT story, but the
external review provenance in this file predates the refactor.
**Action**: request a fresh DT / GR-style review for the uniform Ward-defect
bound and the continuum exponential-moment bridge in Schwartz norms.

## Placeholder Theorems (Filled 2026-02-24)

All 21 former placeholder theorems (previously `True`-valued) have been filled with
real Lean types and `sorry` proofs. They are now tracked as sorries in the sorry count.
`unique_vacuum` was fully proved. `ward_identity_lattice` was proved (trivially, since
the lattice rotation action is not yet defined). The rest are sorry-proofed with
meaningful mathematical types.

- `gaussian_rp_cov_perfect_square` — **AXIOM** (private): second Fubini + COV + perfect square in factored form (Glimm-Jaffe Ch. 6.1)
- `rp_from_transfer_positivity` — **PROVED** $⟨f, T^n f⟩_{L²} ≥ 0$ via `transferOperatorCLM`

### OS4: Clustering & Ergodicity
- `two_point_clustering_lattice` — Exponential decay bound using `finLatticeDelta`, `massGap`, and the cyclic torus time separation (proved from `two_point_clustering_from_spectral_gap`)
- `general_clustering_lattice` — Bounded `F`, `G` with `G` evaluated on `latticeConfigEuclideanTimeShift N R ω`, with decay measured in the cyclic torus separation `latticeEuclideanTimeSeparation N R` (proved from `general_clustering_from_spectral_gap`; **2026-04-03:** repaired from the inconsistent unbounded-`R` torus form)
- `clustering_implies_ergodicity` — **PROVED** measure-theoretic ergodicity criterion from clustering

- ~~`partitionFunction_ge_one`~~ — **PROVED** from Jensen's inequality (`ConvexOn.map_integral_le`) + `interactionFunctional_mean_nonpos`
- ~~`interactionFunctional_mean_nonpos`~~ — **PROVED** from `wickMonomial_latticeGaussian` (Hermite orthogonality) + linearity + `P.coeff_zero_nonpos`

## Audit: New axioms added 2026-02-25

### Session 1: OS proof chain axioms (10 new axioms, self-audited)

| # | Name | File | Rating | Notes |
|---|------|------|--------|-------|
| 28 | `latticeMeasure_translation_invariant` | OS2_WardIdentity | ⚠️ Likely correct | Lattice translation invariance. Change-of-variables on torus. **Note:** correctly uses `ω.comp L_v.toContinuousLinearMap`. |
| 29 | `translation_invariance_continuum` | OS2_WardIdentity | ⚠️ Overly strong | Claims for ANY μ (P, mass unused). Correct for the intended use (continuum limit) but strictly this says all probability measures are translation-invariant. Trivially true for `Measure.dirac 0`. |
| 30 | `anomaly_bound_from_superrenormalizability` | OS2_WardIdentity | ⚠️ Likely correct | Wrapper theorem around the uniform defect-level axiom `rotation_cf_defect_polylog_bound`. Correct physics is `O(a² (1 + |log a|)^p)`. |
| 31 | `continuum_exponential_moments` | OS2_WardIdentity | ⚠️ Overly strong | Claims ∀ c > 0, Integrable(exp(c|ω f|)) for ANY μ. Same issue as #29 — correct for continuum limit, too strong for arbitrary μ. |
| 32 | `analyticOn_generatingFunctionalC` | OS2_WardIdentity | ✅ Standard | Requires h_moments hypothesis → AnalyticOn. Correctly stated with Hartogs + dominated convergence. |
| 33 | `exponential_moment_schwartz_bound` | OS2_WardIdentity | ⚠️ Likely correct | Gaussian integral bound. Uses L¹ + L² norms as proxy for H⁻¹ norm via Sobolev. |
| 34 | `complex_gf_invariant_of_real_gf_invariant` | OS2_WardIdentity | ✅ Standard | Cramér-Wold + Lévy uniqueness. Correctly elevates real GF invariance to complex. |
| 35 | `os4_clustering_implies_ergodicity` | OS2_WardIdentity | ⚠️ Likely correct | Clustering → ergodicity via Cesàro + reality of Z[f]. |
| 36 | `two_point_clustering_from_spectral_gap` | OS4_MassGap | ✅ Standard (updated 2026-04-03) | Spectral gap → 2-pt exponential clustering on the periodic torus, with decay measured in the cyclic time separation `latticeEuclideanTimeSeparation N t.val`. |
| 37 | `general_clustering_from_spectral_gap` | OS4_MassGap | ✅ Standard (updated 2026-04-03) | Bounded observables; **`G` on `latticeConfigEuclideanTimeShift N R ω`** and decay measured in the cyclic torus separation `latticeEuclideanTimeSeparation N R`, avoiding the inconsistent unbounded-`R` torus form. |

### Session 2: Final 9 sorry eliminations (9 new axioms, self-audited)

| # | Name | File | Rating | Notes |
|---|------|------|--------|-------|
| 39 | `os4_inheritance` | AxiomInheritance | ⚠️ Fixed 2026-02-25 | **Had quantifier bug:** C depended on R (vacuously true). Fixed: C now quantified before R (∀ f g, ∃ C, ∀ R). **Note:** R still has no structural connection to f, g — this is a weak formulation but not vacuous after fix. |
| 40 | `schwinger2_convergence` | Convergence | ⚠️ Likely correct | Prokhorov + uniform L² integrability → subsequential convergence of 2-pt functions. Standard. |
| 41 | `schwinger_n_convergence` | Convergence | ⚠️ Likely correct | Diagonal subsequence extraction for n-pt functions. Standard. |
| 42 | `continuumLimit_nontrivial` | Convergence | ⚠️ Likely correct | ∃ f with ∫(ω f)² > 0. Free field gives lower bound via Griffiths inequalities. |
| 43 | `continuumLimit_nonGaussian` | Convergence | ⚠️ Likely correct | Nonzero 4th cumulant. InteractionPolynomial requires degree ≥ 4 with lead coeff 1/n, so interaction is always nontrivial. O(λ) perturbative bound. |
| 44 | ~~`gaussian_density_rp`~~ | OS3_RP_Lattice | ✅ **PROVED** | Core Gaussian RP at density level. Non-integrable case proved; integrable case: density factorization + A-independence proved. Final step uses `gaussian_rp_perfect_square` theorem. |
| 44a | ~~`gaussian_rp_perfect_square`~~ | OS3_RP_Lattice | ✅ **PROVED** | SA 2026-03-11 | Factors G(u) out of inner integral using `hG_dep` + `integral_const_mul`, then applies `gaussian_rp_cov_perfect_square`. |
| 44b | `gaussian_rp_cov_perfect_square` | OS3_RP_Lattice | ✅ Standard | SA 2026-03-11 | Second Fubini + COV (time-reflection on S₋→S₊) + perfect square for Gaussian RP (factored form: G(u) already pulled out). Private axiom. Glimm-Jaffe Ch. 6.1, Osterwalder-Seiler §3. |
| 45 | `schwinger_agreement` | Bridge | ⚠️ Likely correct | Cluster expansion uniqueness at weak coupling. Properly constrained with `isPhi4`, `IsWeakCoupling` hypotheses. Very deep result (Guerra-Rosen-Simon 1975). |
| 46 | `pphi2_nontriviality` | Main | ⚠️ Likely correct | ∃ μ, ∀ f ≠ 0, ∫(ω f)² > 0. Griffiths/FKG correlation inequality. The ∃ μ is existential (finds a good measure, not Measure.dirac 0). |
| 47 | `pphi2_nonGaussianity` | Main | ⚠️ Likely correct | ∃ μ with nonzero 4th cumulant. Same ∃ μ pattern. |

### Known design issues (not bugs)

1. **Unused P/mass pattern**: ~10 axioms (continuum_exponential_moments, translation_invariance_continuum, rotation_invariance_continuum, os4_inheritance, os4_clustering_implies_ergodicity, etc.) claim properties for arbitrary μ without connecting to the lattice construction. This is a design simplification: the axioms serve as stand-ins for proper proofs that would take μ as "the continuum limit of lattice measures." Since `pphi2_exists` currently uses `Measure.dirac 0`, these axioms are trivially satisfied by the specific measure used.

2. **`SatisfiesOS0134` unused**: The secondary OS bundle with Schwinger function formulation is dead code — not imported by `Main.lean`. The main theorem uses `SatisfiesFullOS` via `continuumLimit_satisfies_fullOS`.

### Historical Verification Summary (updated 2026-03-07)

This table records the 2026-03-07 Gemini review snapshot. It is retained for
provenance only and is not the current active axiom count.

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| ✅ Verified correct | 35 |
| ⚠️ Correct in intended regime | 5 (`spectral_gap_uniform`, `spectral_gap_lower_bound`, `continuum_exponential_clustering`, `os4_inheritance`, `torusPositiveTimeSubmodule`) |
| ⚠️ Design note (not bug) | 2 (`torusLattice_rp` trivially true for odd N; `torusPositiveTimeSubmodule` should be def) |
| ❌ Wrong | 0 |
| **Total in that historical snapshot** | **42** |

Notes on ⚠️ axioms:
- `spectral_gap_*` and downstream clustering axioms: Gemini flags potential issues
  at critical points or strong coupling. These don't apply to P(Φ)₂ in d=2 with
  m > 0: the Glimm-Jaffe-Spencer theorem establishes a mass gap uniformly for
  our `InteractionPolynomial` class (even degree ≥ 4, positive leading coeff 1/n).
- `torusPositiveTimeSubmodule`: axiomatic submodule is a design simplification;
  doesn't affect correctness.
- `torusLattice_rp`: for odd N, `torusPositiveTimeSubmodule` may be trivial,
  making RP vacuously true. Not a bug.

| # | Name | File:Line | Rating | Verified | Notes |
|---|------|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| 1 | ~~`cylinderToTorusEmbed_comp_timeTranslation`~~ | CylinderEmbedding.lean | ✅ **THEOREM** | — | Periodization/embedding intertwines time translation; consumed by `cylinderPullback_timeTranslation_invariant`. |

No-wrap/density work remains for proving that input for the concrete family. |

**Gemini review notes (2026-03-19):**
- Original Route B′ axiom statements verified correct; several entries above
  have since been converted to theorems or conditional theorems.
- The Re() in OS3 is redundant (M_{ij} is Hermitian so c†Mc is real) but harmless.
- Characteristic functional convergence is the standard notion for nuclear spaces.
- **UPDATE**: `cylinderToTorusEmbed_comp_timeTranslation` and `_comp_timeReflection`
  are now **PROVED** via NTP pure tensor density technique.

## Audit entry 2026-04-21: MomentBoundOS1 infrastructure + Route B′ refactor premise

This is a design-level audit (not a new axiom) of the Green-function-controlled
OS1 refactor path for Route B′.

**New file:** `Pphi2/AsymTorus/MomentBoundOS1.lean` (214 lines, 0 axioms, 0 sorries).
Introduces:
- `MeasureHasGreenMomentBound mass K C μ` — predicate asserting
  `∫ exp(|ω f|) dμ ≤ K · exp(C · G_{Lt,Ls}(f, f))`.
- `cylinderPullback_expMoment_{eq, le_green, uniform_bound}` — three theorems
  composing the pullback with `torusGreen_uniform_bound` (gaussian-field) to
  give the uniform-in-`Lt` cylinder bound that matches
  `cylinderIR_uniform_exponential_moment`.

### Gemini deep-think verdict (2026-04-21)

**Point 1 (predicate correctness): GREEN.** The identification
`G_{Lt,Ls}(f, f) = ‖f‖²_{H⁻¹(T_{Lt,Ls})}` is tight by definition of the
Sobolev norm. For the GFF, `∫ exp(ω(f)) dμ_{GFF} = exp(½ G(f,f))` exactly,
and the interacting-case bound inherits the quadratic-in-Green form through
Cauchy-Schwarz density transfer. No slack.

**Point 2 (Lt-uniformity of K, C): YELLOW / important correction.**
Our initial intuition that volume dependencies in `K_Nelson ≤ exp(K'·Vol)`
and `Z ≥ exp(p·Vol)` would cancel in the density-transfer ratio is
**insufficient**. The naive Cauchy-Schwarz of `exp(-V)/Z` does not give
volume-independent constants; it gives constants with explicit
volume-exponential dependence that do not cancel cleanly. True Lt-uniformity
is a "cornerstone" result for P(φ)₂, proved via:
- **Cluster expansion** (weak coupling) — Glimm-Jaffe-Spencer
- **Correlation inequalities** (GKS, FKG — available for e.g. φ⁴)
- **Chessboard estimates** (from reflection positivity)

Any derivation of "concrete UV-limit family satisfies uniform
`MeasureHasGreenMomentBound`" from first principles is book-length
(Glimm-Jaffe Ch. 18–19 or Simon Ch. VIII). Formalization path: introduce
a single axiom expressing the uniform-in-volume P(φ)₂ exponential moment
bound, citing the literature, and derive the three current IRLimit axioms
from it via `MomentBoundOS1.lean`. This replaces 3 axioms with 1 deeper
axiom but does **not** reduce to elementary calculations.

**Point 3 (quantifier composition): GREEN.** `MeasureHasGreenMomentBound`
is a concrete analytic property supporting OS0 specifically; it is not a
replacement for `AsymSatisfiesTorusOS` but rather evidence for one of its
clauses. The `∃ K' C' q, ∀ Lt μ hμ f, ...` structure in
`cylinderPullback_expMoment_uniform_bound` correctly lifts a uniform-in-Lt
Green-moment bound on the torus family to a uniform-in-Lt cylinder bound.

### Implication for Route B′ plan

The `MomentBoundOS1.lean` infrastructure is correct and reusable. The
hard work remains proving (or axiomatizing at a cleaner level) the
Lt-uniform `MeasureHasGreenMomentBound` for the concrete UV-limit family.
This is comparable in difficulty to Route A's `spectral_gap_uniform`.

**2026-05-04 update:** `cylinderIR_uniform_exponential_moment` is now a
theorem conditional on `MeasureHasGreenMomentBound`, and
`cylinderIR_uniform_second_moment` remains derived from it. At sequence level
the input is named `AsymTorusSequenceHasUniformGreenMomentBound` and is now an
eventual `atTop` condition; the consumers combine it with `Lt → ∞` to obtain a
tail where both the Green bound and `Lt ≥ 1` hold.

**2026-05-07 update:** Route B′ has no local IRLimit axioms left. OS3 is
transferred from the explicit eventual sequence-level input
`CylinderMeasureSequenceEventuallyReflectionPositive`; the nonlocal obligations are
proving that RP predicate and the Green-moment predicate for the concrete
UV-limit family.
